"I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments!","Bottoms"
"Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!","Bottoms"
"I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer","Bottoms"
"These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.","Bottoms"
"The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it's not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it's one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.","Bottoms"
"Ii'm not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it!","Bottoms"
"Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side, but for me, it was big,,, too bad the smaller size is sold out (well, all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long, below the knee, but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists, adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure!","Bottoms"
"I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight","Bottoms"
"This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too ""out-there"" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely.","Bottoms"
"Like other reviewers noted, the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!","Bottoms"
"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.","Bottoms"
"The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.","Bottoms"
"I bought a petite, size 2. i am 5'3"", 111 lb - it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room. looks just like the one pictured. length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model. very bright with multiple colors. has a nice stretch. very cute.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.","Bottoms"
"I love the color of this skirt, and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated, but fit well.","Bottoms"
"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.","Bottoms"
"Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.","Bottoms"
"I love paige brand pants-they are soft, comfortable, and forgiving. i love these, and want them badly. the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flare-it is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like this-and paige has done a wonderful job for my body.

my store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length. they were significantly too long for me (5'3"") probably 3-4 inches to long. i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for","Bottoms"
"I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.
the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.","Bottoms"
"These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a","Bottoms"
"The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.

very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!","Bottoms"
"I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!","Bottoms"
"I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!","Bottoms"
"These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.","Bottoms"
"I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.","Bottoms"
"I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.","Bottoms"
"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.","Bottoms"
"An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!","Bottoms"
"Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!","Bottoms"
"The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.","Bottoms"
"These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2"", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit.","Bottoms"
"I just received these pants and i am very pleased.  they are a little longer than i expected them to be, but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office.","Bottoms"
"This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8, i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit, not only that, the fabric is very soft and good quality, very interesting style of the jumpsuit, looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped, wide-l","Bottoms"
"I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.","Bottoms"
"I am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner.","Bottoms"
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular.","Bottoms"
"Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)","Bottoms"
"The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.","Bottoms"
"These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!","Bottoms"
"I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2"", 108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture.","Bottoms"
"Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!","Bottoms"
"These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my ""go to"" black pants for the fall season!","Bottoms"
"I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.","Bottoms"
"These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!","Bottoms"
"I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one.","Bottoms"
"I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!","Bottoms"
"Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .","Bottoms"
"I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!","Bottoms"
"I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3"" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads.","Bottoms"
"Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about.","Bottoms"
"I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.","Bottoms"
"These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).","Bottoms"
"I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.","Bottoms"
"This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!","Bottoms"
"Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.","Bottoms"
"These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!","Bottoms"
"Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a","Bottoms"
"These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.","Bottoms"
"I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!","Bottoms"
"I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from","Bottoms"
"Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine.","Bottoms"
"These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.","Bottoms"
"When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!","Bottoms"
"This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.","Bottoms"
"Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.","Bottoms"
"I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.
this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.
the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).","Bottoms"
"These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.","Bottoms"
"These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.","Bottoms"
"These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.","Bottoms"
"I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.

the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.
so glad i made this purchase.","Bottoms"
"Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.","Bottoms"
"I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas","Bottoms"
"Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.","Bottoms"
"Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!","Bottoms"
"I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h","Bottoms"
"Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend","Bottoms"
"Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat, but oh well, they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9""","Bottoms"
"Love it! the pants is absolutely beautiful, rich material, it's not your cheap jogger!
i am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to much.
fits perfect, i am 5'4"" 114lbs and purchase the regular small.","Bottoms"
"Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!","Bottoms"
"I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!","Bottoms"
"Best jeans ever! it's so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!","Bottoms"
"Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!","Bottoms"
"Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.","Bottoms"
"These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.
really, i knew the minute i saw them, i would love them. but, i do have to say that the lovely model
wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu","Bottoms"
"I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i","Bottoms"
"These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!!
i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often
i may have to ban myself from them for a week.
i am 5'4 and the length was perfect for a jogger pant.
i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. 
the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect.","Bottoms"
"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring.","Bottoms"
"I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!","Bottoms"
"I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i don't often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! can't wait to wear these throu","Bottoms"
"I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .","Bottoms"
"This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.","Bottoms"
"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it. 

i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su","Bottoms"
"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try","Bottoms"
"Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ...","Bottoms"
"Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer.","Bottoms"
"I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!","Bottoms"
"I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.","Bottoms"
"I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'1 and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!","Bottoms"
"Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro","Bottoms"
"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!","Bottoms"
"I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)","Bottoms"
"This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.","Bottoms"
"These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn. you could practically sleep in them, they are so comfortable, brushed softness, and stretch easily. they hug your body in a flattering way, that these jeans are worth the money spent, as you'll have them for a while.","Bottoms"
"I'd been eyeing this for months, loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it, with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack, so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt, it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent.","Bottoms"
"Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black.","Bottoms"
"I just bought this at the store. i simply couldn't resist! it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down, sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city, strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event, slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening. can't wait to rock it. in terms of sizing, i am 5'5 150 with 36dd bust and some hips and booty. usually i am a size 6-8/m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style, i ended up","Bottoms"

"I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san","Bottoms"
"Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!","Bottoms"
"This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect.","Bottoms"
"Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.","Bottoms"
"I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.","Bottoms"
"I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great ""medium blue"" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2"" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!","Bottoms"

"I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!","Bottoms"
"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!","Bottoms"
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid","Bottoms"

"Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.","Bottoms"
"It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.","Bottoms"
"This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.","Bottoms"
"Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.","Bottoms"
"I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.","Bottoms"
"Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.","Bottoms"
"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi","Bottoms"
"This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body.","Bottoms"
"I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, "" give it a chance"". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi","Bottoms"

"You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.
colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove.

"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!","Bottoms"

"Beautiful colors","Bottoms"
"I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!","Bottoms"

"Unlike the other reviews, i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material, as is the eyelet overlay, making it a really easy to wear, and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.   
i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt. 
i've only worn it to work dressed up, with boots, but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt.

"As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!","Bottoms"

"The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!","Bottoms"

"I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2"" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can't fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som","Bottoms"
"These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed, pooling even with my highest heels.","Bottoms"
"I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect. i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes, not to mention being long enough for me to wear a 3.5"" heel and still skim the ground. for reference, i'm 5'8 140lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build. i sized up to a 30 which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand, they run tts","Bottoms"
"Love the fabric, so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.","Bottoms"
"I love joggers, best style to come along in awhile. i think these are well made and i like the fabric. i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but that's just a matter of preference. i definitely like them and will keep and wear.","Bottoms"
"These pants are so comfortable and cute!! you can dress them up or down!","Bottoms"
"I ordered these joggers in holly size m. for reference, i am 5'5, 138 lbs, i have a small waist with *thicker* thighs and bum. i was worried that these would make all my ""flaws"" stand out as so many joggers in the past have, but these are not that way at all! they are so comfy and just right! they could easily be dressed up or down. these joggers could quickly replace your everyday jeans or black leggings habit to add a new, more stylish twist!","Bottoms"
"This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick, it is soft, and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my","Bottoms"
"Ordered online and love it,exchanging however from s to m 'cos the fit is so perfect and i want to allow for extra room at the festive season:)","Bottoms"
"Perfect fit, great material, torn in just the right places. can't wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp. in corduroy!","Bottoms"
"Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!","Bottoms"
"Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs)","Bottoms"
"Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!","Bottoms"
"Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so","Bottoms"
"Love these! i'm a big fan of ag stevie jeans and these are no exception. the mid rise is terrific and the distressing is cute without being crazy. i like how the holes are not at the knees, which can be annoying when bending your legs. i would love to see these offered in a darker rinse and also in a cropped length. fit is perfect on these - fun and flattering! keep the stevies coming retailer!","Bottoms"
"These pants fit great!! i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly. i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there. i think i will get a lot of use out of these!","Bottoms"
"These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.","Bottoms"
"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took","Bottoms"
"I love this so so much. i'm 5'1"" with a short torso and post baby 34d boobs. the 6 petite is perfect. it's the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch, height, and leg area. so excited to wear this!","Bottoms"
"I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty.

sadly, they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants, but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size.","Bottoms"
"Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.","Bottoms"
"Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.","Bottoms"
"Hi, i bought these in both colors. the material is very nice. for me the only part of the pants that stretched was the waistband. sadly i had to return them.","Bottoms"
"Purchased these in both colors today. (great sale price.)
hei hei is my favorite brand of pants, especially their pull on prints.
i am always a medium, these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach. i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each.
the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up. the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous. they have a lovely silky feel to them. i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness won't bother me. being on","Bottoms"
"This is my second pair of joggers from retailer and since this purchase, i have bought another pair. it seems that they are just a great fit for my body, long and lean, but not extreme. someone said they run large, but my experience is true to size. these pants can be very casual around the house, out for errands or dressed up and worn for casual evenings out. i love that the elastic waist isn't bunchee. they hang very straight and pretty, just like in this picture. the fabric has some text","Bottoms"
"Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash, so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist, slim hips, flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.","Bottoms"
"Love love love these pants!!! super comfortable and fit true to size.","Bottoms"
"I always love the arielle jeans. every color seems to be slightly different in the fit, but they are always slim enough in the leg and thigh to be stylish without being too restricting. to echo the other reviews, the pockets are a little low on these compared to other arielle cut jeans that i already own. i have a fairly straight, athletic shaped body and went with my 'larger' size to wear them as more of a boyfriend fit. the fabric is a very soft and forgiving denim and the dark color can be dr","Bottoms"
"Got these shorts in both colors: the blue-gray and the red-pink. super lightweight in hot humd weather, and keeps a crisp shape (doesn't get wrinkly and saggy like other linen shorts do). really nice quality interior finish and both front and back pockets are a usable depth.
.
if you're between sizes go for the smaller as they do stretch a bit over the day. i got these in a size 2 and they get a little loose on my 33""-25""-37ish"" frame. i'm 5'2"" and the petite was sold out, so i don't know if t","Bottoms"
"Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9"" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4"" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!","Bottoms"
"I'm not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif. the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey. the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk. i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pear-shaped gal. i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter. i thin","Bottoms"
"This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!","Bottoms"
"Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality!! stop here and buy these!!!! you will not be disappointed!!!","Bottoms"
"These are by far the sexiest fitting overalls ever! they are lengthening and flattering and comfy at the same time!","Bottoms"
"These are absolutely fabulous!!! love them! comfortable great fabric! best buy of the year so far!","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love these pants! i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper. i've always liked the look of these pants but didn't think i had the body type to pull them off being 5'5"" with some curves. i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small. i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips. the draping isn't as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didn't add weight to my frame. the mate","Bottoms"
"First off, the pictures online hardly do these justice. these pants are way cool. they are soft, have the perfect little pattern, they have a great tie detail on the cuff, they are higher waist (which is always more comfy), and they are super stylish! just like the other reviewer, i am occasionally hesitant on drop crotch pants...but i was so drawn to these. i'm glad i have them a shot because they are way better than i expected! these are worth the buy!","Bottoms"
"I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o","Bottoms"
"Just buy these! i bought the olive green color and loved them, so i bought the navy blue. they fit true to size, i'm a size 4 and bought the 27. they are comfortable and make your bum look good. i prefer skirts, dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer, and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather. you can wear them casually or dress them up.","Bottoms"
"Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...","Bottoms"
"I'm curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if you're trying to hide hips, these aren't for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great.","Bottoms"
"Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!","Bottoms"
"I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!","Bottoms"
"Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.

i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.

i do wish they came in more colors.","Bottoms"
"I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack, in a moss green color. the material, cut, and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent. they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket. i got them in size 26, and they fit perfectly. highly recommended - with the 40% off of sale items, they cost $42 + tax.","Bottoms"
"Was worried these pants would make my 5'2"" frame appear even shorter, but no, they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand, but will remember this brand for the future.","Bottoms"
"I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black, army green, and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.","Bottoms"
"I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.","Bottoms"
"I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them.","Bottoms"
"I bought one pair last year and two more this year! i love them! they fit tts and the ""red"" ones look exactly like the picture.....more of a pink color. super cute color! buy these shorts!!!","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love these shorts!!! everything about them is perfect!! i have them in almost every color. they wash beautifully. i don't dry my shorts in the dryer. they fit the same as last years'. i'm thin & pretty straight with little hips. i wear them in a size 28. i tried the 27 & they felt a little snug. i don't like my shorts tight & i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not (like the model in the picture). i don't find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul","Bottoms"
"These shorts are perfect. not too short, but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my ""hyphen"" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose, order true to size. they do stretch at the waist, so if you want them to fit true to size, order one-two sizes down.","Bottoms"
"I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.","Bottoms"
"These shorts are age-appropriate for all. they're loose fitting and cal me rolled up or left down where they end above the knee. the fabric is soft and colors are fun","Bottoms"
"Bought these shorts in the store, in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe. for some reason, the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully. the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot. love pilcro!!!","Bottoms"
"These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!","Bottoms"
"Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.","Bottoms"
"These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors. i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since it's not ""hemmed"" to a certain length. i ordered the pink/salmon color and they go with so much!","Bottoms"
"Great shorts. i've been buying these for the past few years. each year, i add to my collection with new colors. i have 8 pairs now! perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg.","Bottoms"
"So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year, i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom","Bottoms"
"I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on, but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first, they are definitely short when rolled twice, and i do not have skinny legs. in fact, i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason, these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer, but i still like them at home","Bottoms"
"I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila' - i love the shorts too! colors are great and you don't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they're versatile and who doesn't love options?????","Bottoms"
"I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.","Bottoms"
"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about","Bottoms"
"I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend, well made too.","Bottoms"
"These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.","Bottoms"
"Wonderful flattering fit, mostly cotton so very cool and huge color selection. i bought 3 pair. thrilled with pilcro. 
only thing that could make these better would be if made in the usa.  cuffs roll down if you want less sun.","Bottoms"
"I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year, these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!","Bottoms"
"If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.","Bottoms"
"I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear","Bottoms"
"This is my second pair of these jeans (i ruined the first pair and immediately ordered a replacement). wear them all the time. i did go up one size to get a better fit (i don't exactly have slim thighs--ha!), but other than that, they are pretty perfect!","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans ~ the are so soft, so comfortable, nice fabric weight...not too heavy or stiff at all, very flattering, best of all they move with you, but do not completely stretch out by the end of the day ~ i am on retailer site now to purchase another color~","Bottoms"
"When i saw that these were on sale, i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately, the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants, i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long, i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however, it was well worth it.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!","Bottoms"
"I purchased an xl and am 5'8""tall. the pants fall near the ankle just like the pic. i plan to wash on my gentle washing machine cycle. the texture fabric print will pair well with any printed tops you choose. these lounge pants are great for everyday wear especially for errands in town. so much better a choice than yoga pants which to me look ridiculous when wore in public. so ladies, please leave your yoga pants for the gym and treat yourself to these casual, comfortable pants. i have two pairs","Bottoms"
"I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large. it is very comfortable, light and it is lined! i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year, gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! 

only ""con"" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes, but maybe they make it in petite...?","Bottoms"
"Stunning! i got about 6 compliments the day i wore it. 2 different men i barely know said ""you're really rocking that outfit."" 

i wish they made this in petite as the xs is slightly big (i'm 5'3"" 106 lbs) but i kept it anyway since i'm both a little underweight right now and also since i was able to roll the top so that it was an appropriate length to wear with flats. 

i paired with a denim shirt- perfection.","Bottoms"
"As the previous reviewer stated, this skirt is a stunner, can be worn in all four season. it's long and runs on the larger side. so that you compare, i'm 5'9"" and it goes all the way to the side of my foot. i'm 146lbs, 28 waist, 38 hips and always a medium on maeve, this skirt on a medium was too big for me, at least a size larger. take that into account when ordering. other than that it's a great purchase. can't wait for my exchange to arrive.","Bottoms"
"This skirt has a more dusty black background than the website lets on, which i love. the floral pattern is delicate and subtle, and the tiers give this gorgeous skirt the perfect amount of flounce. it is so versatile! the quality is excellent. the skirt is fully lined. it will take me easily through three seasons (the weight of it might make it a bit too warm for summer). i'm so happy i bought this!","Bottoms"
"This skirt has a beautiful, flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and, of course, the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year, dressed up with jewels, or down with boots and a casual sweater.","Bottoms"
"I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still, i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort","Bottoms"
"I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3"" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly.","Bottoms"
"Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it, despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.","Bottoms"
"I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular size 27 (5'4"", 27/35, 116bs) and they fit me just perfect so they are tts. they are super soft and there's just enough stretch in these that i'm able to bend easily yet they retain their shape nicely. the pockets in the front are super cute in person and the back gives a really cute look. the color is just as shown in the picture, a nice shade of blue that's in the middle plus they are really incredibly soft. i'm only 5""4"" but found the regular","Bottoms"
"I definitely agree with the other reviews, however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up, or down, as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6, or 8 (28/29), and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants, so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store, but worth it!","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt its like a denim feel so there is good structure, love the colors anything goes with it, and i love pockets very comfortable day skirt for just around town","Bottoms"
"The gorgeous coral color of this skirt makes it a great all seasons skirt. the slightly heavier weight of skirt makes it extremely adorable for fall/winter. pair it with some tights, chunky knit and booties, good to go. very flattering one. has a slight a-line cut to it. i love love this one.","Bottoms"
"I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality, so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!","Bottoms"
"Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4', 135, size 4-6, took a 6. something about the pocket placement, fabric weight, cut, and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.","Bottoms"
"I found this fit tts for me. i'm normally a 10/12 and took a 12. fit and length are great. the fabric felt substantial and the colors are soft.","Bottoms"
"Wow! love this skirt! and i totally agree with reviewers--this item runs a full size small. i am normally a true six on bottom and it was a bit too tight considering i would wash/dry/shrink. the size eight is perfect. fabric is very good twill and forgiving... $19.95 and 40% off!!! cannot wait to wear my bargain skirt next summer!!!","Bottoms"
"I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite. i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style. the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch. i like this darkly uniform shade, slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays. you need to size up on your usual ag size, however, to get the perfect fit.","Bottoms"
"These pants are beautiful. great fit and great fabric. really comfortable and elegant. i am tall 5'8"" and have a long torso so it's nice to find pants that are high waisted.","Bottoms"
"What a find! this skirt is so soft and fits like a dream. perfect shape and length. i've been looking for more pieces to match a couple of fabulous pairs of purple shoes i have, so this is just the ticket!","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans so much i have 4 pairs. i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year. i am 5'4"" 112 lbs. with a slim, straight, athletic build. these jeans look amazing on; they don't have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs weren't cut right, i don't have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on. sometimes when i try on skinny jeans, they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird. not these, i ju","Bottoms"
"These run a tiny bit large, but i'm still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable!","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans- they really added something special to my wardrobe!

size: 
i purchased my normal size in the store and was worried they wouldn't stretch out. the sales clerk helping me order the larger size alerted me that these will stretch a full size as i wear them but i wanted to be sure so i ordered the larger size just in case. 

i received the larger size and when i tried them on i could feel them stretching out right away and feeling too loose. i kept my normal size and wore th","Bottoms"
"Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!","Bottoms"
"Fit great and cute. cannot wait for summer to wear with sandals.","Bottoms"
"Although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me! love the material, style, just doesn't look right on me!","Bottoms"
"This caught my eye straight away and it hasn't disappointed on either. really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions. high quality and slimming vertical stripes too.","Bottoms"
"I love these pants so much, i have them in two colors. they are super comfy, light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great, great buy. i highly recommend them.","Bottoms"
"These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on! they're not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way and/or with a formal look. i just wish black jeans didn't always have that odd rubber smell. other than that, these are great!","Bottoms"
"These jeans immediately caught my eye online, and when i saw them in the store on display, i knew i had to at least try them on. they are absolutely adorable. i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom. great fit, and great stretch. i wore them for the first time today, and i had at least four people i didn't know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans.","Bottoms"
"I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans, and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.","Bottoms"
"Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.","Bottoms"
"I love these shorts, the subtle floral pattern is even prettier in person. the drawstring waist allows me to customize the fit for my newly pregnant belly.","Bottoms"
"I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co","Bottoms"
"I have never tried this brand before and was pleasantly surprised at the fit! i especially like the button detail as it makes them a little more dressy and different. i plan to wear with a simple white tank and sandals. i will definitely look for this brand again!","Bottoms"
"These are fabulous pants.  they can easily  be worn to work.  best jeans/pants ever for women with no butts!!  they stay up, and they're comfortable. 
i can't  speak highly enough for these.  don't  ever stop  making them, retailer!!","Bottoms"
"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#","Bottoms"
"I actually love these jeans. i feel they run true to size. i actually love the button detailing at the bottom. makes them unique and different from the other jeans in my closet. i can wear them dressed up with heels or wear with sandals.","Bottoms"
"I love pilcro's jeans. they fit adults without being mom jeans. the quality is great. the legging cut is simple with just the right amount of stretch. they're a tiny bit short but i like to show a little skin in booties.","Bottoms"
"These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy, stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off, the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!","Bottoms"
"These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly, i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer, and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size, they are adorable!","Bottoms"
"The petites fit perfect!!  these are so comfortable, i will get much us out of them!","Bottoms"
"I'm 5'5"", 115 lbs, with a 25"" waist and 35"" hips. i purchased a 25 and the fit was perfect. i'm just a bit short waisted, have a rather small waist and often find that pants of any kind gap at the back. these fit perfectly, felt great on, and i love the fabric.","Bottoms"
"Loved my. mustard colored ones so much, i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!","Bottoms"
"I'm a 5'7""and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!","Bottoms"
"Very comfortable. im 5'2 so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length. no need to roll up. slightly slim fit but not overly tight. typically order everything online and didn't need to return. ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded black/dark grey.","Bottoms"
"Great chinos, but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size, i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!","Bottoms"
"Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable, looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering, but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.","Bottoms"
"I am 5-9 1/2"" tall, 150 lbs, i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also, they did not have my size in store, so they had them shipped, for free, to my home. received them within 3 business days.

i would very much recommend them for a casual, fun look. the honey color will look great with navy, grey, and white for summer.","Bottoms"
"Earlier this year i bought a pair of pilcro hyphen's as a birthday gift for a family member, and she absolutely loved them! after hearing from her how comfortable and amazing the pants are, i had to get some for myself! i usually only wear denim pants, everything else is skirts, dresses or shorts. so this was a big change in style for me.so far i love them, they are way more comfy than i had expected and made from great material!
i'm 5' 2'' and 120lbs. they 27s fit perfectly. i do not have slim","Bottoms"
"Bought the pink color in the store and just loved the way that they fit me. i ended up ordering the light blue. perfect for a cool summer evening. can be worn with sandals, wedges, or converse sneakers!","Bottoms"
"This is my third pair of these pants. they are my everyday staple, good for work or play","Bottoms"
"These pants are so great! they fit as expected and are a nice skinny crop but nothing too tight. the fabric is very soft making these pants incredibly comfortable. this was my first pair of the stet crops but will probably buy another pair in the future.","Bottoms"
"These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8"" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal.","Bottoms"
"I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer","Bottoms"
"I bought 2 pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time! these chinos are great for my figure. i like to think of myself as a ""diamond"" shape ;) large chest, moderate waist, large hips, and small legs. these pants fit so great!!! i bought my regular size and don't have to take in the legs! the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who aren't 20 or 30-something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy! i'm not a teeny woman either","Bottoms"
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. i love the hyphen chinos, and these fit almost the same, just a bit trimmer. they are not tight, and just skim my body perfectly.

3. i love all the colors. the red is darker than the two hyphen pinks.

4. the pants are comfy enough to be really casual and dressy enough to wear to work.","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love these capris. after reading the reviews, i thought that they may fit a bit snug through the thigh, but they fit perfectly. i am roughly a size six (depending on the design, i can sometimes squeeze into a 4). i bought the size 27 in these and its perfect. also, i thought that the green would be more of a mint, but its definitely a more of a mossy color. i love that they are so versatile and literally go with everything! will be getting more colors in the future! great buy!","Bottoms"
"Cute, comfy, and would highly recommend them to others. i plan on getting one more color because i feel like i will wear them all the time!","Bottoms"
"The perfect summer pants. i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size. i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size. i bought a size 31 petite in the dark blue (not navy) and they fit perfect and the color is amazing. very high quality, feel very soft and comfy. for reference, i'm curvy, 5'2"", 146 lbs, usual size is a 31 (10-12) but i've recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off. the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos.","Bottoms"
"I'm not much of a chino girl, but these fit like a favorite pair of jeans and with heels still look really polished. love them!","Bottoms"
"I'm so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors. i have bought 3 colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these. i'm 5""1, 104 pounds and took the 24p since this runs a size large. my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer. these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed. love them and highly recommend these!","Bottoms"
"Perfect fit for my size. it elongate my petite frame.","Bottoms"
"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry","Bottoms"
"When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9"" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.

i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!","Bottoms"
"I love this skirt! it is unique and flattering clothes like this skirt, that brought me to retailer in the first place. as the first reviewer said, this is a well-made striking skirt. it is tts (i usually wear a size 2 - and the size 2 fit perfectly; i am 36-17-36, and 122 lbs, 5'4"".) the skirt is lined and is very comfortable to wear.","Bottoms"
"I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i don't like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!","Bottoms"
"I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot. you can dress it up or down, and since it's comfortable you will want to wear it a lot. i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner.. i bought 2 jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite. the fit is flattering, fitted but not tight and the self-tie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass. i am tall and i normally take an xs or s. i went with the s to ensure that it was long","Bottoms"
"I'm 5'10"" and have athletic legs. these jeans are so comfy, long enough, and look good on the booty. the photo is deceiving as they are much longer. i wish they carried more colors. it's hard to find a jean i really like and i really like these.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11"" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it.","Bottoms"
"This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2"", 102 lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it's not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!","Bottoms"
"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.

i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on. 

i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4"", the petite is the way to go. however, i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a","Bottoms"
"I'm 5'8"" about 134, somewhat of a pear, and these jeans in size 28 fit like they were made for me. plus, the fabric is really soft and comfortable and i love the color. ankle opening is more straight than skinny, which is a change from my usual skinny jeans, but i like it.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is so beautiful!! it's a bit small, but only a tad. i can still wear it, and it encourages me to lose 5lbs haha! i get compliments everywhere i go.","Bottoms"
"Great jeans in a lovely shade of grey. they are longer than shown in the picture, however, which i love. i haven't worn mine yet, and i wonder how stretched out they'll get, but overall the fit is quite flattering.","Bottoms"
"Kind of silky, but to a point where they almost look like pj pants. i am not sure if i will keep, but overall nice feel. i tried on a xxs p as it was a return, xs sold out, so went with it, stretchy enough to fit me... (115 lbs)","Bottoms"
"Very comfy versatile skirt. the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on. i live in hawai'i so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here. the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work.","Bottoms"
"This is a great skirt to add to your closet. i love it. it is comfortable, soft, and has detail to it. i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out.","Bottoms"
"These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i","Bottoms"
"These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.","Bottoms"
"These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased, and i have not been disappointed! jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town. fit stays true even after first wash. wish i had a pair of these in every color.","Bottoms"
"I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ","Bottoms"
"Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall. it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest. it has a slightly a-line shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches. i took a point off for it not being lined, and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper. i took my usual small and like how it fits. my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since it's a fall skirt and will always be wo","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.

rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.

wish you carried these basics at all times.","Bottoms"
"Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.","Bottoms"
"This is a nice looking skirt. the corduroy has a little sheen to it. looks cute with a sweater, tights and boots. length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo. there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits.","Bottoms"
"Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.","Bottoms"
"Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.","Bottoms"
"It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.","Bottoms"
"This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7"",125lbs and the small fit.","Bottoms"
"This fits so perfect! it is light fabric, not clingy. very flattering! i am 5'4 120lbs with athletic build.","Bottoms"
"I wasn't sure how this was going to look on me, but it was so darned cute, i had to give it a try. and i love it! i'm 5'4"" around 130lbs and i bought both a small and a medium to try. the medium fit best. the length is perfect. hits just a little bit longer than the model but almost the same. the material is light but nothing see thru about it. it is slimming and looks so cute on! so glad i gave it a try.","Bottoms"
"This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!","Bottoms"
"This is m frist pair of flares, and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed, but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly, but combined with the flare, the high waist is","Bottoms"
"I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.","Bottoms"
"I purchased this romper over a month ago and love it! i ordered a s and would say that it is true to size. it falls well and i love the blousy look on top. it is expensive at full price, but i purchased it with a promotional discount. luckily, before i washed this (as the tag says handwash only), i read the reviews in which some reviewers had said that they followed the directions and it still shrunk. i let it sit in my hamper until today after i read online about using dryel and rayon. dryel in","Bottoms"
"This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!","Bottoms"
"I just received these pants and they are really cute. they are casual but i think with a cute top/jacket and heels they can be appropriate for a fun night out or casual date. they are really comfortable but they do stretch so size down for sure. i am 5'5"" and weigh 130 lbs and wear a 4/6 in antho. pants that aren't chino fabric but wear a 28 in designer jeans. i ordered a 26 and can probably wear a 25 when these stretch out. i will keep the 26 but they will be baggy. i ordered the kakhi and the","Bottoms"
"I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable","Bottoms"
"I ordered these in teal and once they arrived, i bought another pair in gray. great for casual office wear or weekend errands. a bit of a stretch in the material and a true to size fit.","Bottoms"
"I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.","Bottoms"
"I fell in love with these cropped pants & first purchased a size 31 but realized that they do run true to size so i exchanged for a 30. i usually wear an 8-10 pant size.

i am so happy with these chinos!","Bottoms"
"These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!","Bottoms"
"I usually wear a 27 in ag and other designer jeans. i ordered a 29 based on the other reviewers. they fit like the model and look great. i might have been able to go with 28 if these end up stretching out, so i'm hoping they don't. they are nice and thick for white jeans, yet soft and comfy.","Bottoms"
"Just received these pants today and i absolutely love them! the material is super soft and the fit is true to size! i ordered the tan color. i really like the wide leg and the frayed bottom!! i may order the gray too!","Bottoms"
"Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.","Bottoms"
"I love these pants, they are soft versatile and stylish! great choice!","Bottoms"
"Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing.  i'm an 8-10 and size 30 never fails to fit perfectly.  i've got hips and a booty so it's great to have a brand that works with my curves.  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants i've had for years -- broken in but still look polished.  i bought the green (which is really teal) and feel in love with them. i've since bought the gray and sand/khaki color.  i'm 5'6"" and the length hits just below","Bottoms"
"These pants are a great fit. perfect for the in-between seasons. casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn. a practical steal at retailer's sale prices.","Bottoms"
"Love these wide-leg chinos. they are super comfy and the fabric is incredibly soft. the size fit true for me. i would buy these again.","Bottoms"
"Love these! the raw hem is on-trend! length is great (i'm 5'6""). material is the classic pilcro washed chinos. perfect. as with all pilcro pants, they stretch a bit. :)","Bottoms"
"It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day","Bottoms"
"I agree with the other reviewer, this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give, a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up, usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.","Bottoms"
"I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!","Bottoms"
"Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love","Bottoms"
"This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine, comfortable, and moves beautifully when you walk. can be used all year round!","Bottoms"
"These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.","Bottoms"
"I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.","Bottoms"
"I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.","Bottoms"
"I love pilcro script jeans. the rise is super comfortable and the fabric stretch is perfectly flattering without being too tight. the wash is great. from the pictures, i didn't realize this pair had the fringed bottom rather than the hem, but they cuff easily if you want to hide it. plus, with boot season approaching, i think it will make boots more comfortable without the bulky hem. i wish they would make this cut with all of their products - would love to see a pair of cords or dress pants!","Bottoms"
"I loved this skirt. they didn't have my size anymore so i tried on a few others. i really needed a small p. otherwise i totally would have kept it!","Bottoms"
"This price is amazing and goes with everything! fits great! so glad i made this purchase.","Bottoms"
"Cute casual skirt, i love that it is longer in the back than the front so i can comfortably wear it to work.  i had to size up, which i usually do in bottoms that do not have stretch because i'm my athletic frame.","Bottoms"
"Love these pants. i have several pairs of the pilcro scrip (and formerly super script). these do not have quite as much elastic as some cuts, but they still fit well and look great.","Bottoms"
"I bought these in the store yesterday and am thrilled with them.

sizing: they run large. i am glad i bought them in store because i was planning to buy the 28s and the 26s fit instead. for reference, i am 5'4"", athletic, postpartum, 135 pounds. 

fit: inseam is very long. waist is a flattering v-shape, versus straight across the midline. i find these a little lower rise than i'd ideally choose--they hit around 2 inches below my navel. the back pockets are small and high. i find the butt are","Bottoms"
"This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy, requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!","Bottoms"
"This skirt is fabulous!!! i ordered it in both grey and green. only flaw was the grey one was 2 inches shorter all the way around (made it too short!!!), so i kept the green. great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is soft and comfortable, breathes and moves really nicely. great quality and fabric, just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings. i ordered my usual medium, but probably could have sized down to a small. i plan to wear this all the time.","Bottoms"
"These make your rear look ah-maz-ing!!! i mean, seriously good. every time i wear these, my husband cannot keep his hands off. usually, i'm 27/28, in these i took a 29. perfection. i also got them in the black and blue washes. i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point. so good. awesome price point too.","Bottoms"

"I can't think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone's fabric, so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7"" frame. feels like wearing pajamas, with the benefit of looking put-together!","Bottoms"
"Like these pants and they were on sale--does not get better!","Bottoms"
"At 5'3"" and 155 pounds with a short waist, it's hard to find attractive jeans. hit the jackpot with these. they're comfortable, very slimming with a perfect rise and length. i ordered size 32 so i did go up a size. love the button closure instead of a zipper. these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much. try these, you won't be disappointed!","Bottoms"
"Don't think the photo does this skirt justice. it's a very flattering fit, the kind of skirt you'll wear all summer!","Bottoms"
"These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.","Bottoms"
"These pants are perfect for any closet! they can be casual weekend or paired with a light top and heels. very comfortable. love the detailing around the pockets.","Bottoms"
"Seriously, most comfortable pants ever!!! fabric feels very luxe. are they dressy enough for the office? i don't care, they feel that great.","Bottoms"
"I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.","Bottoms"
"I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because i'm short waisted so don't normally like high rise pants. i finally pulled the plug when i had a 15% off code (still expensive imo). i am so glad i finally bought them - they are well worth the price! i am 5'6"" with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate. they hit about 2 inches above my ankle bone, which suits me just fine. they are","Bottoms"
"The embroidery is actually navy blue, not black like it shows in the photos, which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)","Bottoms"
"I purchased these jeans in my regular size.  they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels.. i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look. they are very stretchy and soft. have worn a few times and they retained thier shape...","Bottoms"
"I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco","Bottoms"
"Love the colors for fall, feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!","Bottoms"
"There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.","Bottoms"
"Love just know the embroidery is navy blue wearing them today, size down","Bottoms"
"I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!","Bottoms"
"I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans! when i saw them in my retailer store, i instantly fell in love. they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online. they're definitely a boyfriend fit, so if you're between sizes, go down a size. i've already gotten tons of compliments!","Bottoms"
"These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes, even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!","Bottoms"
"This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it's not ""pull on styling"". it has a side zipper. fits true to size, but is longer on me than the model, but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!","Bottoms"
"These pants have great style and movement.","Bottoms"
"I am usually between a 8 and a 10 and was an 8 in this skirt, it is very nice because it has so many soft colors in it and will go with anything. i live in florida so for me this is a fall skirt! i like the look of a wrap and it is not a wrap it fits great.","Bottoms"
"These pants are so comfortable, it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9"" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.","Bottoms"
"Fit great. hang nice. extra loop to hold belt. perfect design.","Bottoms"
"I love this jumpsuit! i'm usually a size small, however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs. the fit was comfortable and sexy! i received a lot of compliments and a couple of ""i need to borrow that from you""! i'm only 5' tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with 4"" open toed heels and it worked! the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort. i highly recommend this jumpsuit ...even to the petite ladies!","Bottoms"
"I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik","Bottoms"
"I think i've made a hobby out of trying on jumpsuits & rompers this season. i now own three (including this one in my usual size small: 32d-31-38). i passed right by this on-line but it drew my attention in the store. i didn't realize it was chocolate brown and ivory (i'm a sucker for brown). i tried it on on a whim and it looked great. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and it looked great. i will say it shows off my bottom (for better or worse) more than other jumpsuits. it doesn't give me a wedgie but a","Bottoms"
"First of all, this is so much prettier in person. if i were looking online, i would have scrolled right by this beauty. i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses. in jeans, i am a size 8 or 10 but i always have to get the waist taken in (little waist, big thigh problem). this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy. also, there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary. the scarf can also be tied behind the neck","Bottoms"
"I am so happy i decided to try this on in store. it is absolutely stunning! unfortunately they only had a m and it was a little too flowy so have the s ordered and anxious to try it on. the top is really where i am concerned it is too large. i am 5'3"", 36dd and 130#, athletic build. since you really cannot wear a bra with it, which is okay btw, the armholes were a little too open and afraid things may show ;). the bottom fit okay, a little on the large side but this should fit loose and flowy. c","Bottoms"
"I've been wanting to buy a romper that was easy to wear and take off and i like this one for many reasons. the elastic waist ""holds"" the romper in place when you take the top off, the top comes off easily bc it's a halter and the design is very chic and sophisticated. the only down side is the tie is really heavy if you tie it in the back. it's better to tie it in the front like the model in this picture. it is a bit long (comes down to my ankles) but looks good with heels.","Bottoms"
"I'm another borderline petite at 5'4"", and i loved this. the pants are like palazzos on me, and i think with a heel it will look great. i plan on wearing my hair up and tying the tie in the back in a big bow. in fact, i don't see the button back spoken of in the description, so i think one would have to do so!","Bottoms"
"Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes.  as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small.  i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans, sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over, and uncomfortable.  i don't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great.  sizing definitely off on these.  i am 5'3"" 115# for reference.","Bottoms"
"This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent, and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist, so keep that in mind. the only t","Bottoms"

"The ""movement"" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some, ""yeah, i can wear these attitude!"" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is ""thick"" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs, and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh","Bottoms"
"These are just as cute as pictured. they are generously sized made from soft denim. the denim has quite a bit of stretch. i ordered a size down from my normal size. i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets. they were still attached to the inside of the pockets. it just made them feel a little unfinished. these didn't impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment. the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three strap-length adjustments on the straps. the","Bottoms"

"I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.","Bottoms"

"This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu","Bottoms"

"As stated in my review title, they're amazing! they're incredibly well made, have just the right amount of stretch, and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work, or at least where i work, where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length, which being at 5'3 isn't surprising. they're about 3 inches too long. i'm a size 8-10 and got the large. i couldn't recommend these enough","Bottoms"

"These cords are so soft and snug on- like a hug for your lower half! i appreciate their lack of stretch: they don't seem to ""bag out"" like other cords can. i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff. the grey is slightly lighter/more silvery in real life than the picture depicts. for ref, i'm 5'2"" and 103lbs and i bought the 24p.","Bottoms"

"So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : )","Bottoms"

it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.","Bottoms"
"This romper is so dang cute. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it. it's not too sheer and the shorts aren't too short (i'm 5'9). my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on, an easy fix but still it should come off that easy.","Bottoms"

"Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts. i usually get 1 every year. the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern. so it is versatile to wear with many colored tops.
i bought a large because they didn't have medium in the store. it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable . the rest fits nice and slim. i am usually an 8-10 in jeans.","Bottoms"
"If you love denim skirts as much or more than you love the perfect pair of jeans, then you'll love this one! the waist fits perfectly with just enough give from the spandex to make this skirt comfortable all day without stretching so much that you'll wonder if you should've bought a smaller size. it's also a great length for fall/winter and looks fabulous with boots. i just wish i could find the perfect buttondown shirt so i can tuck it in and show off the cute detail buckle in back!","Bottoms"
"It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona's is very stylish, well made, and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 12 and am awaiting its arrival, remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 12 so can't say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.","Bottoms"

"I am 5'6"" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt, which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down, it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted, for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband","Bottoms"
"Extreme comfort for travel and out door activities.","Bottoms"
"I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.","Bottoms"
"Great alternative to yoga pants, these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!","Bottoms"
"This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!","Bottoms"
"These jeans are amazing. they are so comfortable.  they have a great amount of stretch but do not sag even after wearing them all day. i am 5'4"" and 135 lbs and purchased  my usual size 27. i did have to have them shortened 
but only b/c i bought in store and did not have the petite online option. i have worn them on several occasions. great purchase.","Bottoms"
"I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.","Bottoms"
"These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5"" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them.","Bottoms"
"These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.","Bottoms"
"I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.","Bottoms"
"Softest denim -- they feel like they've been through the wash a hundred times already! i'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me. i'm 5'4"" and bought the petite for a perfect fit. these will become a go-to pair!","Bottoms"
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys, the 27 fits very comfortably. 

i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.","Bottoms"
"I have been waiting for these to go on sale for some time now, and so happy to day they still had my size...in both colors. i don't usually buy 2 things the same in different colors, but in this case, i did...

fit true to size for me, almost had a hard mite buttoning... but they are stretchy, so don't buy a bigger size, they will stretch. could not decide which color to keep so kept both... i ordered the 25p (0p) - i am 5'1.5"", and 115 lbs... i think these are vanity sized, but my usual vanit","Bottoms"
"I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse, but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day, i decided i needed another pair.

feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!","Bottoms"
"Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips, butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!","Bottoms"
"Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.","Bottoms"
"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/39, hips 36/37. tried the size 27, the usual for me in pilcro. they fit like a glove and i loved them. i clearly needed a 2-3"" heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear i'm a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky.
a win!","Bottoms"
"I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans. they are flattering and don't sag after wearing them for a hour or two. they look great with flats or booties.","Bottoms"
"I ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model...not tight at all and very flattering. even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering...makes my legs look long! i am 5'4"" and about 118#. the material is so soft and substantial...the color is very accurately portrayed online. i can't wait to wear this fall!","Bottoms"
"I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans, had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27, but the waistband was a bit tight, so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2"" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off, they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured.","Bottoms"
"I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 31 but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to, but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the ""sagging out"" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.

i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo","Bottoms"
"These pants are flattering yet comfortable. i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am 6 feet tall. the 36 inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of ""high water"" pants. the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful. the high rise waist is wonderful. these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions. they are great.","Bottoms"
"These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist, which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared, long leg! very long, in fact. i'm 5'5, 130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work, with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out, i'd order another pair - they are","Bottoms"
"Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.","Bottoms"
"They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.","Bottoms"
"Sits slightly below waist, i bought size 30p, length is good no alteration required for petite height 5'4 and 136lb. material is good and i recommend them.","Bottoms"
"I have a tough time shopping for jeans because almost everything that fits my butt is too big in the waist. also, i have thick thighs so that's an issue and i hate shopping for jeans. these are so much cuter on than on the hanger. try them. you won't regret it. so flattering.","Bottoms"
"I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe, especially when paired with a dressier top, blazer, skinny belt and heels. also, i like that the jeans don't have the to","Bottoms"
"I am a huge fan of all things ""mother"" brand now. they fit great and are true to size! they have just the right amount of stretch, but maintain their fit all day.","Bottoms"
"I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt.  it is adorable! saw it in the store.  it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear.  i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly.  i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out.  colors are southwesternish.  can be worn with any color top.  i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.","Bottoms"
"This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website.  i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again.  i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on.  perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo.  you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt.  i wore it to a work meeting and can't wait to wear it again.  it's a bit on th","Bottoms"
"This skirt is beautiful, i even have the perfect shirt to wear with it, sadly, though, i have to decide between too many nice things... what to do! i tried on the 0, and it fits me perfectly. above the knee, waist just right (26.5 in). colors are fun and great for fall, but could also summer-ize the skirt.fabric is thick, however, and well-made. i highly recommen, but leave a 0 for me!","Bottoms"
"I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!","Bottoms"
"My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. 

 i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.","Bottoms"
"This is my favorite purchase so far! i am in love with this jumpsuit. it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom. i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it! you won't be disappointed.","Bottoms"
"This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).","Bottoms"
"This is a super cute jumpsuit that is also super comfortable. the only thing i wish was different on this jumpsuit is that the pants would go all the way to the ground. but it is still super cute and a keeper !","Bottoms"
"Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, shouldn't fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.","Bottoms"
"Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8"", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them","Bottoms"
"I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.","Bottoms"
"This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. 
it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.
i cant wait to wear it this summer.","Bottoms"
"I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small. i didn't find that to be the case and think they run true to size","Bottoms"
"The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel","Bottoms"
"The details on these capris are adorable - the stitching and side ribbon detail, the fit, weight of the fabric, everything is fantastic. i got the taupe and moss green because i couldn't decide. i wish they came in more colors. fit, for me, was true to size, i usually wear a 2 to a 4 (size 26 to 27 in denim) and got the 2 because i wanted them to be more fitted. they stretched a bit after wear, but not so much that they were too baggy. i will live in these, this summer. if you want a more fitted","Bottoms"
"I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!","Bottoms"
"I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it's lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i'm 5'3"" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have","Bottoms"
"This skirt is so gorgeous. the picture doesn't do it justice. several layers of mesh. i am 5'10"" and this skirt is very long, which i love. so glad i found this in my size for such a great price. highly recommended..","Bottoms"
"Love these pants! the print is very different, a little quirky, but black and light golden brown mixed together so very versatile. i have very thin legs and these are actually tight on me so maybe too slim for some.good length. they actually hit right at the ankle.","Bottoms"
"I'd been eyeing this skirt on the website, and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store. i couldn't leave it behind. the silver embroidery and the lovely, flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt. i'm just over 5"" 4"" and it skims the floor on me with a 2"" heel. can't wait to wear it!","Bottoms"
"This dress is very beautiful. the dark color makes it very elegant. i tried on different top (white, silver, light blue, etc). they all look very nice with the dress. you can wear it casually or formally...depending on what kind of top you wear.","Bottoms"
"I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.","Bottoms"
"These pants are amazing and great quality! thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size. the trousers don't have a lot of stretch and are very cute and well-made and the size up is perfect! i am normally a 2r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a 4r, they are perfect. gorgeous pattern, and i too, am not a ""pattern""-type. will go perfectly with a number of the solid, flowy maeve tops i have for work.","Bottoms"
"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.
i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well","Bottoms"
"I have the blue version. i love the bold, pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.","Bottoms"
"I got this planning to wear to a wedding, but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said, it is long, but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!","Bottoms"
"These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.","Bottoms"
"Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu","Bottoms"
"This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.","Bottoms"
"Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!","Bottoms"
"These jeans look amazing on. i'm 5'5"" and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly. if you like high waisted jeans, these are for you! a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldn't say they are excessively long.","Bottoms"
"I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color, soft, flowy, fun, practical.","Bottoms"
"Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.","Bottoms"
"I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33"" inseam is correct. however, i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!","Bottoms"
"Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily, these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.95 with 40% off!!!???? yes please,  cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer, you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store, then you are on your own!","Bottoms"
"Fits just like on the model, even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.","Bottoms"
"I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality, and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8, but my store only had a 4 available. it fit, but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model, but i'm on the short side.","Bottoms"
"I love this skirt! it is sooooo cute!! fits true to size and the color is beautiful. the cut out in the front gives the skirt a sexy touch, the fabric is very nice, i am in love! this was one of my best purchases from retailer!","Bottoms"
"First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.

at any rate, i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers, i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t","Bottoms"

"Great skirt, fits as expected. very cute, can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!","Bottoms"
"I've seriously been on the hunt for a olive green military-ish style skirt for a couple years now and i think i've found it! the color is great! the finishings are cool(rose gold buttons!) i actually like the a-line, it give me room to sit down without riding up. the waist is pretty fitted, verging on tight and i ordered an 8. i'm usually a 6 or 8 in bottoms, but i need to trim off a few pounds from a recent vaca! so i'm keeping the 8, it will probably be perfect soon enough! the length is just","Bottoms"
"The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!","Bottoms"

"This skirt is really cute and very comfortable. i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual. fun color too.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt... perfect length and cut! pilcro, make more of these!!!! i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist, just prefer that better, but i think if you can pull of the waist look, go for it! would buy more in different colors!","Bottoms"
"Just got this skirt in the mail and i am so happy i took a chance and ordered it! my waist is a lot smaller than my hips so skirts can be a challenge! but this one fit me perfectly! it is casual but i can also see myself wearing this to work in the summer months. it is super flattering and very comfortable! the fabric is soft and it does have some give. i am usually a size 30 in pilcro chinos and the size 10 in this skirt fit me perfectly. so i would say it runs true to size. a great addition to","Bottoms"
"I'm in love with these jeans! they come very long, but it's easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed. i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted, but still flattering, which surprised me! for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, and i got the size 24.","Bottoms"
"I bought the skirt in green in size 6 (i am 5'4"" and 143 lbs). it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect. i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer.","Bottoms"
"Blue jeans that fit like a dream & they were on sale.","Bottoms"
"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer, i ordered one size up, and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i can't wear a wedge heel or anything with them, but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it's not overdone. just like in the picture, they really seem to narrow the hip, think page boy style. very, very flattering!","Bottoms"
"This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summer...great green/khaki color, casual. fit me like all the retailer size
8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.","Bottoms"
"I'm 5'7"", 120 lbs, size 0 was best.  ordered the green color.  great flattering fit!","Bottoms"
"The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1 ,103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!","Bottoms"
"These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4"" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans, not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.","Bottoms"
"I really loved this skirt on the model. i ordered it in my typical 0 and it fit well. the green was adorable, and the buttons are rose gold, which is quite pretty. i did exchange this skirt for a 2, only because the 0 was just too short for me. if the 2 is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist, i will probably keep it. i was surprised by how large the a line felt, but i think i can get used to it. it really is very fun, and very easy to dress up or down. i'm really hoping the bigger si","Bottoms"
"I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months, or layer it with a sweater, thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style), but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4, which fit me perfectly. it's nice that","Bottoms"
"This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.","Bottoms"
"Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt, easy to wear and very flattering. looks better in person, i saw it at the store and bought it; when i looked at it on-line i didn't realize it was the same skirt. this is a ""go to"" skirt, comfy and sexy all in one! even wore it to the airport with a pair of boots and sweater....super comfortable and still looked nice! great purchase!","Bottoms"
"I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt, sweater, cardigan + t, whatever, and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.","Bottoms"
"Great quality and cut! they are so versatile, which i love! highly recommend these!","Bottoms"
"These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely ""relaxed"" and look a little baggier on than in the photo, but still cute and flattering.","Bottoms"
"I'm so glad to own this one. i just tried it today and fully satisfied as always with pilcro. true to size, perfect color.
high waisted and flare just right. can be paired with cropped top or peasant top. looking taller on this outfit!
best of all i got it on sale!","Bottoms"
"The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4"" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31"" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch, the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.","Bottoms"
"Love the pilcro brand, they are one of my favorites, even compared to other more expensive denim brands. i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time! i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut. sadly, i have to send these beauties back and hope for a pop-back.","Bottoms"
"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase.","Bottoms"
"Nice jeans, fit true to size and look as pictured. i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well.","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.","Bottoms"
"I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3"", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not","Bottoms"
"I was hesitant to order high rise pants, seems they only ever look good on a tall person. but these worked out perfect, i'm barely 5'6"", and the pants are just as long on me as the model in the picture, just barely brushing the floor when i'm in heels, though if i'm honest they do touch down a bit which will scuff them most likely, but to tailor 1/4 inch seems ridic. love them, super sexy, slimming, and elegant, the color is rich and the material is not too thick or thin, very comfortable stretc","Bottoms"
"Love these jeans!! i ordered one pair and liked them so much i ordered another right away! i ordered the 26 regular.
yes, they are too long (i'm 5'4 1/2""# for flats, but look fantastic with heels #i need 2 1/2"" - 3"" to wear with these).
the fit is comfortable, they stretch just enough to look nice and still move with you. they are not binding at all.

the first time i wore them i got so many compliments. i even had a friend tell me she did not understand why flares were coming back because she t","Bottoms"
"I loved this skirt. the material is so fun and a love the pattern. unfortunately they didn't have the size i needed so it had to go back to the store","Bottoms"
"These were as great in person as i had hoped; great color for fall, super comfy and flattering fit. happy with my purchase!","Bottoms"
"I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!","Bottoms"
"I haven't worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained. these are as soft as my leggings. they have so much stretch, you could do yoga in them. if you want the jean look w/o the stiffness/structure, get these. flattering to the booty too.","Bottoms"
"I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.","Bottoms"
"Love everything about these! they are super fostering and comfy. i am a busy mom and need comfort. these are a great addition to my closet. super cute with booties, wedges and flats.","Bottoms"
"They fit me great, are super comfortable. they are casual, yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online, too","Bottoms"
"I have always had a thing for velvet, and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured, but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3"". they can be dressed up, but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide","Bottoms"
"Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose, these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .","Bottoms"
"Classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated. my husband loves them on me. for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer. i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t.","Bottoms"
"Let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. (i live in a warm area). i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the top---even though it is meant to be baggy 

 the bottoms on the medium fit me great- they shorts don't b","Bottoms"
"I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous, i would have preferred a 30 inch inseam, but 31 is by far better than 34, that many designer jeans at department stores run.","Bottoms"
"I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4"" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's.","Bottoms"
"These are perfect for pulling off a finished look, proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial, lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!","Bottoms"
"I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great, the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.","Bottoms"
"Great fit and style. i got the navy and the color is beautiful.","Bottoms"
"I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants. they are so comfy and keep their shape very well. when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair. i purchased navy and the color is beautiful.","Bottoms"
"Love the pilcro brand! size down!! super soft, well fitting, great length. great darker color for fall. awesome rise. not too high, not too low. will be grabbing these a ton this fall.","Bottoms"
"Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend!","Bottoms"
"These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down, in my opinion. right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly. i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last 2 yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on, they stretched out so much it was annoying. 
these script jeans are amazing, flattering and are a nice lightweight denim. i wore them a few times before washing and","Bottoms"
"I love all jeans by mother, they are well made, fit great and look so cute with any type of shoes from heels, to flat to boots. these jeans are perfect to wear out or when paired with a blazer can be worn to work. i love these and have them in almost every color.","Bottoms"
"These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but won't rip further. i wear these at least once a week.","Bottoms"
"I am one month post partum and have had so much trouble finding jeans that fit. 
my old jeans fit in the legs and thighs but not my new tummy.
i love my old pilcro jeans but didn't want to spend the money on jeans in a size so much larger than my norm.
well after ordering other brands much cheaper i broke down...spent the money and sized up. i am normally a 27 and ordered a 30 due to waist size. they came today and fit like a glove.
i am so happy! it's worth every penny to wear jeans that fi","Bottoms"
"This is a cute pair of jeans. it has a slight flare and just right amount of fringe. they are super soft and and the color is slightly lighter than in photos. tts, not too low hitting right below belly button and a just the right crop length for my 5'4"" height falling ri right above my ankle.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt. it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog. so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales. i love it. thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway. the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me (petite) winner","Bottoms"
"Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.

cons: slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag- i'm optimistic this will mostly go away though. expensive.

fit: i'm 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34b, normally wear a 26 or 27 in pants, and the size 2 fit great. i often wear a size 4 in skirts despite a size 2 fitting fine in","Bottoms"
"I'd been eyeing this for a long time but couldn't afford the full price. when it came on sale, my size -- regular 8 -- was sold out. so i took a chance and went with the petite 8 (only difference is length). and am i glad i did!

it fits beautifully, even a little roomy. but the length is perfect. the longer pieces are at/barely below the knee, and the shorter flap is about two inches above. (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 135 pounds, measurements 38-30-38.)

the skirt is substantial, with high-qualit","Bottoms"
"Love this substantial pieced suede skirt by leifsdottir. the photos i posted show the color in daylight on a cloudy day. a bit more muted darker turquoise than the online pictures. imagine a mini pencil skirt made of non-stretch polyester with a suede front panel. over this is the longer, open skirt, which is attached at the sides to keep it from flying up when you walk.

sizing: based on the reviews i risked ordering this in a 00p. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37ish with narrow hips, fuller behin","Bottoms"
"These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy, relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!","Bottoms"
"I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!","Bottoms"
"These jeans are exactly what i was looking for. love the rich olive color. these are definitely an olive green and not a brown color, which i was very happy about. fit is great, i am 5'7"" 150 athletic hippy build and a size 29 fits great. they are the perfect ankle length jean. very soft, and just the right amount of stretch.","Bottoms"
"Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.","Bottoms"
"These are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found!! people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand! flattering, comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out! highly recommend!","Bottoms"
"I'm obsessed with the perfect"" leather look "" coated jeans.. i have another high end denim brand in black.. i may like these better.. they fit perfect maybe a tad big?
high enough so potential bottoms shows when bending .. perfect stretch ..
not to leathery looking just enough. the ties at ankle are different ...
i would love these in black! but this color is awesome, and this cut very flattering . for reference i'm a 16 bottom, smaller waste bigger booty .. size 33 fit perfect ..","Bottoms"
"Love the fit and color, but the material is my favorite. it's so soft and comfy. feels like your walking around in your pjs!","Bottoms"
"These are the most comfortable trousers in my whole wardrobe.  love them.","Bottoms"
"Not for shorties. i'm 5'3 and will need to get them hemmed.","Bottoms"
"Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long, so i will need to shorten.","Bottoms"
"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can","Bottoms"
"Almost the perfect skirt! great colors,super cute fit,very flattering,great length,very versatile. only issue was size; normally a solid 10, i ended up a full 2 sizes smaller. very stretchy and comfortable,just try it on first or order a couple of sizes. go down at least 1 size. as others have said...pilcro strikes again,its such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics.","Bottoms"
"These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes, the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...","Bottoms"
"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.","Bottoms"
"I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant. they are indeed both!","Bottoms"
"I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight , and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60's vibe that i love. i think it should keep it's shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large, as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this","Bottoms"
"Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27"" waist, 37"" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit, especially around the waist, but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look","Bottoms"
"I am 5'3, curvy and wear a size 12 and these pants look amazing! often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump, however, the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering. even if you don't think culottes will work for your body type- i suggest you give these a try.","Bottoms"
"Well made. color is great, goes from summer right into fall. looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on. goes well with classic tee, denim shirt or plaid blouse. has a retro/ classic look.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i'm usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been","Bottoms"
"Great versatile skirt, very flattering","Bottoms"
"I tried this skirt on because i liked the green color thinking that the pockets would not be flattering to my size 12 figure. i was wrong. the pockets are flattering to a round tummy. the pocket flap is stitched down on the side and button near the center so they don't stick out. a good skirt for fall.","Bottoms"
"Beautiful skirt with a fun, graphic pattern and embroidered texture. i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare. they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back, plus it looks best at your natural waist. i'm 5'2"" and often need to wear petite, but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size. looks great bare-legged or with tights. love the pockets too!","Bottoms"
"I typically wear a 26 in jeans and in these i got the 25 and they fit perfectly. i ordered the 25 because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got. they are well made, a nice dark wash and with the size 25 a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit. i'm only 5'3"" so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled. i've worn them two days in a row and they haven't stretched out...highly recommend.","Bottoms"
"I usually wear a 27 in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a 26. the 27 was very large in the waist. they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little.","Bottoms"
"I found this skirt in a size 8 at my local retailer store. i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing. i tried it on and it fit beautifully, a style that looks great on my figure. i love the mohair weave of the color block sections. the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size 8 was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size 8 were very slim. i am still admirin","Bottoms"
"Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!","Bottoms"
"I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it. the only thing is, i'm usually a 2 or a 26 and had to buy a 6. for reference, i'm 5' 7 and about 120 pounds. if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in, i'd recommend you go up a size as well!","Bottoms"
"This is a great casual skirt, i ordered the 0p or xs petite and it fit perfectly. both colors are nice, i don't think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt, so leaning towards the slate color. the fit is also flattering, waist is snug, but not tight. the fabric is soft, could wear in the fall or even winter with tights. i recommend... (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist)","Bottoms"
"Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26"" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.","Bottoms"
"Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.","Bottoms"
"Saw this in my local and retailer store and had to have it! well made and easy to dress up for down. perfect with a light weight shirt tucked in for summer and early fall. i recommend sizing up one size.","Bottoms"
"I bought this skirt in my local store when it first came out. i have to say it is one of my best retailer purchases ever. fits beautifully. works with a tee, tank, denim shirt, and more! i get so many compliments every time i wear it. will be wearing for many summers to come! runs tts. i am 5'10"", 155 pounds and the 8 fit perfectly. it is not too short for work, but my legs do need to be tan to wear it.","Bottoms"
"Such a cute skirt. it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty. it fits well and it is true to size.","Bottoms"
"These are the best jeans ever! never wore pilcros before and only ordered them because they were on sale. so glad i did! now i'm hooked!","Bottoms"
"Skirt fits true to size, i bought a regular size 2 even though im only 5 feet because i didnt want it too short. the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee. bold, vibrant color and great quality! also very unique, which is what i look for at ahtro. recommend, give it a shot!","Bottoms"
"After a rough day at the office, i went into my local retailer to seek out some retail therapy. i stumbled upon this skirt and knew i had to try it on. though it's more than i normally like to spend, it was well worth the price. material is lightweight and comfortable yet substantial enough for work. fit is spot on (i have wider hips and a smaller waist, which typically makes me a size 12 and that's what i bought). the color is a gorgeous mustard yellow that can be paired with all sorts of colors,","Bottoms"
"With a skirt so vibrant, it's hard not to feel happy wearing it. i tried this on in store, following a spring fashion show. while i usually need petite sizes for length/proportion purposes (i'm 5'4, slender build), the regular size 2 was a great fit and length. any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt (and i don't necessarily mind a shorter length, but this was beautiful as it was). the price is a bit steep, but the quality of the material justifies it. the one","Bottoms"
"I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.","Dresses"
"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small","Dresses"
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.","Dresses"
"Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.","Dresses"
"There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced.","Dresses"
"I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.","Dresses"
"I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. 

do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.","Dresses"
"Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.","Dresses"
"I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.","Dresses"
"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!
i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.
the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.","Dresses"
"The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.","Dresses"
"This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(","Dresses"
"This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.","Dresses"
"I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately, it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and, it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet, but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly, it is going back.","Dresses"
"This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however, the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.","Dresses"
"This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.","Dresses"
"I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.","Dresses"
"No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.","Dresses"
"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.","Dresses"
"This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.","Dresses"
"I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice","Dresses"
"I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.","Dresses"
"I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online, but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo","Dresses"
"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.","Dresses"
"I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.","Dresses"
"I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room, the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well. 

i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co","Dresses"
"I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o","Dresses"
"Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately, the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well, but was poorly made. based off other reviews, this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.","Dresses"
"This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall, a pretty horrible dress. save your money,","Dresses"
"I'm usually a fan of maeve, but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy, and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose, it just droops in a most unfortunate way.","Dresses"
"This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!","Dresses"
"This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if it's difficu","Dresses"
"I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.","Dresses"
"Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.","Dresses"
"This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.","Dresses"
"I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large, i usually wear a large, and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad, it looked adorable and i was so excited to try","Dresses"
"I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug","Dresses"
"I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well.","Dresses"
"Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.","Dresses"
"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.","Dresses"
"This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.","Dresses"
"As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.","Dresses"
"I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.","Dresses"
"So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.","Dresses"
"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn.","Dresses"
"I was so excited to buy it online, but it come in a small plastic bag, and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got, so i had to return it","Dresses"
"I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.","Dresses"
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  
i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.
for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,","Dresses"
"Thought this would be a great dress for warm days, but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8, usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape, this is a great dress with nice detailing, but sadly the shape did not work for me.","Dresses"
"Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.","Dresses"
"I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail, i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape, material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.","Dresses"
"As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.","Dresses"
"The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can't wear this again.","Dresses"
"After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.","Dresses"
"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr","Dresses"
"As the previous reviewer mentioned, the pockets ruin this dress. pockets, usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress, so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.","Dresses"
"Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!","Dresses"
"This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.","Dresses"
"Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.","Dresses"

"The title says it all. looks very pretty online though.","Dresses"
"Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo, although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what","Dresses"
"I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. 


fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull.

"This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it.","Dresses"

"I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!","Dresses"
"I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!","Dresses"
"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t","Dresses"

"I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.","Dresses"
"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'","Dresses"
"I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.","Dresses"
"I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them, i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut ""keyhole."" i am sooo happy with my purchase.","Dresses"
"This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.","Dresses"
"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes","Dresses"
"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! 

i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews","Dresses"
"Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!","Dresses"
"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.

"This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out, and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.

"I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut, but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.","Dresses"

"Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.","Dresses"
"Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath","Dresses"
"I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.","Dresses"
"This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.","Dresses"

"I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.","Dresses"
"Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.

the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. 

looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b","Dresses"

and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.","Dresses"
"This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted, almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly, not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.","Dresses"

"Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.","Dresses"
"Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5""), it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter, the sleeves are huge, the neckline was falling off my shoulder, i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes.","Dresses"
"When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.","Dresses"

"I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.","Dresses"
"This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.","Dresses"
"Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like","Dresses"
"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.","Dresses"

"Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l","Dresses"

"I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.","Dresses"
"I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.","Dresses"
"Generally, i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent, so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition, the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this, and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!","Dresses"

"I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco","Dresses"

"I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the","Dresses"

"When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.","Dresses"

"I had such high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3, 105lbs, the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress, but regardless, they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.","Dresses"

"I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states ""dry clean recommended."" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once.","Dresses"

"The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned","Dresses"

"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.","Dresses"

"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but","Dresses"

"I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass, ladies.","Dresses"

"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(","Dresses"

"I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large, however the arm/shoulder area is tight.","Dresses"

"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.

"Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.","Dresses"
"The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2"" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2"" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.","Dresses"

"So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money, but i needed something to wear that was transitional.","Dresses"
"I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price, i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade, but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f","Dresses"
"I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton, and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur","Dresses"
"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it.","Dresses"
"I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure, and such a shame when th","Dresses"
"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.","Dresses"
"The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering, the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail","Dresses"
"I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.","Dresses"
"I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.","Dresses"

"The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined. although the color is beautiful, the cheap fabric has no variation, is too saturated, and lacks any sheen of quality silk.

"This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite, short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.","Dresses"
"I had high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.","Dresses"
"The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown, i really wanted to love it but it's going back.","Dresses"

"This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.","Dresses"

"I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.","Dresses"

(i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back, and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.","Dresses"

"It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/","Dresses"

"I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall, thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest, and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.","Dresses"

"I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled, but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny, and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny, not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again, maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3"" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle","Dresses"

"Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea","Dresses"

"I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips , then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because ,i realized that the lining was very sticky, and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me, not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute, and i really liked the look of the dress, if it goes on sale i may purch","Dresses"

"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust, truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms, if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this","Dresses"

"I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was ""warm and cozy"" and not itchy at all, but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair.","Dresses"
"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered, but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities, for me, ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4"" and 125, hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me, like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it.","Dresses"

"I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.","Dresses"
"I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.","Dresses"
"The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point, i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress, be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur","Dresses"
"I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy.","Dresses"
"I can't believe how small this thing runs. beyond small. it's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work, but there's no way it's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty.","Dresses"
"Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.","Dresses"

"This dress looked gorgeous, light and lacy in the picture, but when it arrived, the ""lace"" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy, sequined material. it was uncomfortable, scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress, so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si","Dresses"
"There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"".

"I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress, had the fabric been different, i think it would be a great dress.","Dresses"
"Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price, it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack, and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!","Dresses"
"I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one, one side hung longer than the other, and on all 3, the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot","Dresses"
"This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.","Dresses"
"I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door, but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly, so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow, but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.","Dresses"
"I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .","Dresses"

"Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't.","Dresses"
"I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.","Dresses"
"It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy, even though it's brand new. it fits fine, but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny, like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front, which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible,","Dresses"
"I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.","Dresses"
"Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.","Dresses"

"On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.","Dresses"
"I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away, i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person, the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny, as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that, but then i tried it on. i ordered a small, which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall, between the coloring and sizing, this dress wasn't a hit for me.","Dresses"
"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12.

"After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black","Dresses"

"This dress is great. it appears just as it does online. its soft, flowy and a thin chambray material. the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women. i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them. i tried a large (i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses) and there was plenty of room! i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized. the dress is a midi length, very breezy and airy. its extremely comfortable and very fl","Intimate"

"This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.","Intimate"
"I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.","Intimate"
"This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however, it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side, but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale, so i am keeping it.","Intimate"
"Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b.

"I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.
the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work, because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.","Intimate"

does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do","Intimate"

"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!","Intimate"
"I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.","Intimate"
"I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu","Intimate"

"I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s","Intimate"
"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small","Intimate"

"This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!","Intimate"
"Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.","Intimate"
"These tights are so cute, but the sizing leaves much to be desired. i guess they are true to size since they are labeled s/m.

i'm 5'0"" with shorter legs than torso, and i suppose i'm lucky that i have muscular (read: large) quads/thighs to suck up some of the fabric, otherwise these might have just bunched up at my ankles.

the other thing i don't love about them is the feel of the fabric - it's more sweater-like (and not a soft sweater) than stretchy. maybe that was the intent, but i find tigh","Intimate"
"This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight","Intimate"

"I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade.","Intimate"
"Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.","Intimate"
"I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.","Intimate"
"I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!","Intimate"

"Loved the way these felt but like the previous reviewer said it did run slightly large. i am usually a size 6 or m and the legs were a little baggy w/the medium. since the m is sold out i'm going to try and see if they shrink in the dryer. the color and design of the ankle is different from other leggings which is a plus. i'm 5'7"" and they are the perfect length.","Intimate"
"Nice but i thought these ran big. me: 28-29' waist, 36"" hips, athletic thighs. usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise. hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty, the ankle detail is fun and decently made.","Intimate"

"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down.","Intimate"

"So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!","Intimate"
"I tried these on in the store because the pattern of dots caught my eye and it looked like a nice easy style to wear. the waist hits a bit low. i wasn't crazy about the rayon fabric and would prefer it in cotton. i decided to pass on it for now as i don't really need sleep pants; but i might be tempted if they go on sale.","Intimate"
"I am usually a 32a. i ended up with a 34 b based on sales assoc input and what was available. the 32 gave me back fat ( i do not have back fat) so she said the 34 would be better, it ran small etc. the 34 also fit ( had to be ordered and mailed) but it still gave me ""flab"" over the back band. comparing it to my other regular bras, i can see that the band has too thin fabric and rolls and has ""harder edges"" compared to wider , thicker band on my other bras. very pretty but i will be returning. sa","Intimate"
"Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2""), though fits like in photos.","Intimate"

"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.","Intimate"
"I'm so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.","Intimate"

"This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back, and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping, and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this, but as it is i will keep the one","Intimate"

"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6"", 32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining, and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty, but not much else.","Intimate"
"Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that's the only negative.","Intimate"
"Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose, relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me, but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture, great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!","Intimate"
"This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft, comfortably loose, but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!","Intimate"
"This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.","Intimate"
"The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.","Intimate"
"This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture, and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite, could not recommend enough!

"I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.","Intimate"
"Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!","Intimate"
"This is great, lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. it's sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.","Intimate"
"Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent","Intimate"

"I was so stoked about this swim suit.  i bought it for mine and and my husband's anniversary trip.  it didn't disappoint.  it was gorgeous.  amazing quality. fabulous on.  unfortunately in my case though - the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my c-section scar. so it had to go back :(","Intimate"

"These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants, definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.","Intimate"

"I couldn't agree more with that first review. i would add that it does run large.the leg holes are big. beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture. soft fabric and thin elastic waist band. no fake string tightener or buttons. simple and romantic. yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in:)","Intimate"
"Like the other reviewer mentioned, this jacket has a very trim fit, so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.","Intimate"
"I wanted to love these, but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute, but unfortunately must go back for me.","Intimate"

"I love the ruching on this hoodie, which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small, 34b, 130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).","Intimate"

"First i must say that i bought this zip up hoodie because of the material and how incredibly soft and comfortable it was - absolutely worth the price. however, the sleeves were about 4"" too long! because i am a seamstress, and this was an easy hem for me i went ahead and purchased it and hemmed up the sleeves, but i was honestly shocked how long they were. you would have to have very long arms for this to fit you without alterations. if you don't mind rolling them up i suppose it might work as w","Intimate"

"I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose, and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price, i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.","Intimate"
"I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown, but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere, which just seems wrong in this style pant. also, take note, these are slit up the side, which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit, but still, does c","Intimate"

"The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering, particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable, and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys, it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).","Intimate"

"This dress has really great features--the style is adorable, and i love the color. the contrasting color straps are a nice feature. the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a rather thin material. not quite sure yet if i should wear it as a dress or simply as a swim cover-up.","Intimate"
"I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6"" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.","Intimate"
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!","Intimate"
"I agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin, and it would make a far better swimsuit cover-up or pajamas than an actual dress -- unless you don't mind that it is semi see-thru. however, that said, i do love it! it is soft, the cut on top is nice and the strappy back is pretty, and it is flattering -- as long as your tummy is fairly flat because it does hug your body as you move (so no bread and pasta). i have worn it a couple of times already, and i have received compliments on","Intimate"

"This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10"" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!","Intimate"

"This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even, and maybe especially, because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire, which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size, but might run a tad lar","Intimate"

"I tried the xs in store and waistband is very stretchy and the material is lightweight (feels delicate) and to the floor. fell in love with the watercolor print. this would be great as a quick cover up over a bikini. beware- if you plan on wearing this anywhere besides by the beach, make sure to rock your nude undies because the cream color is super see-thru, which is my least favorite part of this piece. i couldn't get to the petites sizes before they all sold out, so i'm crossing my fingers th","Intimate"
"Very pretty and comfortable. it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits. it was located next to regular pants, but once i tried it on - i realized it was somewhat see through. i still got it as its very lovely. i'm going on a beach vacation, so i know i'll use it over bathing suits. honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway, since its so different and pretty. i bought a large as i'm a 10-12 and its still pretty loose.","Intimate"
"I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.","Intimate"
"Bought these for my honeymoon to hawaii- they will be perfect for lounging. very comfy, but a little see through so likely not to wear on their own.","Intimate"
"Have not worn them yet, but they are so soft and pretty. seems like a good item to travel with.","Intimate"
"Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing, i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.","Intimate"
"This swimsuit is so beautiful and fits wonderfully and is very flattering. comfortable fit as well. love it!","Intimate"
"Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again, but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream ""look at me"" (let's be honest, there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi","Intimate"
"Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i","Intimate"
"Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering.","Intimate"
"This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!","Intimate"
"I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!","Intimate"
"I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste, but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami, but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets, so i'm not terribly concerned.","Intimate"
"I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price, but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing, and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust, and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.","Intimate"
"This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.","Intimate"
"This is a lovely, light coverup with a beautiful pattern, however, in the catalogue it appears blush pink when in reality it is white. the model must be wearing a pinkish swimsuit underneath the caftan giving it the allusion of being a color which it is not. i still like it enough to keep it but am disappointed that the item description did not mention this optical illusion.","Intimate"
"Perfect! can't believe how inexpensive this is for the look. it looks just like it does on the model. i can't wait to wear it on my vacation.","Intimate"
"I ordered a large and it was skin tight, if that's the look you're going for..","Intimate"
"Cute print on both sides, but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy, but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top, so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.","Intimate"
"These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.","Intimate"
"These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!","Intimate"
"Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.","Intimate"
"Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit","Intimate"
"I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute, fashionable tights that aren't ""heavy"" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great, don't roll or bunch, don't shrink, have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!","Intimate"
"I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however, the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.","Intimate"
"Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight, not too thick and not too thin. they will run, so be careful when washing or putting them on.","Intimate"
"These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses.","Intimate"
"These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.","Intimate"
"Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.","Intimate"
"These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.","Intimate"
"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.","Intimate"
"The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.","Intimate"
"I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!","Intimate"
"Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!","Intimate"

"I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras, so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras, the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck, or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt, the top of the cup shows. bummer!","Intimate"
"I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.","Intimate"
"This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.","Intimate"
"This was just what i wanted. a simple design (so many of retailer's suits have way too much going on) and this one fit the bill. sexy, strappy and clean. i can't wait to live in this top this summer.","Intimate"
"I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l, usually wear l/xl, i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much, i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back, but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up, it runs too small.","Intimate"
"I love these bottoms they are super cute, comfy and very flatering. finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies. its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low :) and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top. i am normally between a size 8 and ten 145 lbs. and i ordered size large.","Intimate"
"I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous. 

not only does it fit well and run true to size, it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on, and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a","Intimate"
"I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4"" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!","Intimate"
"These tights are wonderful, exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person), definitely true to size, and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.","Intimate"
"This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.","Intimate"
"I took this in a large. im a 36d 140lbs. this top in a large fit me perfectly without a bra. slightly see through but not by much... i haven't tried it with a bra on yet, but im sure it'll be just fine.","Intimate"
"I was eyeing this sweatshirt but didn't want to pay full price- i got it on sale and am so happy i did! it is super soft and comfy. it also fits perfectly- not too baggy but also not form fitting. as a moz fan i couldn't pass it up. awesome sweatshirt!","Intimate"
"Perfect semi-dressy summer top, that could definitely go year round. love the buttons up the back. it's flows but the slight peplum keeps it from looking tent like. love this so much i ordered another in black.","Intimate"

"This is a must have! way cuter in person. love the look and feel. it runs large so size down. it's more cream than white","Intimate"
"I adore a good vest, so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often, but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it, took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl, and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line, and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin, or even w","Intimate"

"Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too ""mom"" like.","Intimate"
"I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors, but after only a few minutes of wearing them, i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28, and ordered these in a m, but i guess they were still too small, which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty, but i will not be ordering more.","Intimate"
"Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.","Intimate"
"I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a","Intimate"
"I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.","Intimate"
"I love these leggings so much i bought them in every color/design!!! they are amazing!
super stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates, yoga, playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls.","Intimate"
"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10"", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.","Intimate"
"Wow! this sure is close fitting, as in suction cups to your body! yikes, definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me, it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it, not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs, it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.","Intimate"
"After surviving the winter months in various combo's of flannel and wool, i was craving something feminine to wear for lounging and sleeping while traveling the mediterranean with a friend. this little gown looked ideal. the lace is very feminine, and smoother than i feared. i reserved a single star over concern that the jersey knit of the body won't hold up to the test of time. it is not sheer, rather just opaque enough so i won't be self conscious. the curved, high waist is flattering.

"I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.","Intimate"
"I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if","Intimate"
"This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.","Intimate"

"These sleep pants are very pretty, soft and comfortable. unfortunately, after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?","Intimate"

"This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute ""lounge at the lake"" ensemble.","Intimate"

"The weight and feel of this jacket is what i was hoping for. it is medium weight making it my go to on cool days and is also very flattering to wear...it actually gives you shape! i like the front texturing on the scroll work and the pockets are well placed. if anything could be different, i would have preferred a little more room in the sleeves as they run slightly snug so not made to wear with anything with bulk, but overall not an issue.","Intimate"
"Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'11 and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.","Intimate"

"I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big, but with a longish shirt it's fine. also, they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!","Intimate"

"This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s","Intimate"
"Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.","Intimate"
"I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.","Intimate"
"I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece","Intimate"
"This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.","Intimate"
"I love the cardigan. it's super comfy and long enough to cover my behind. the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch. it's a little tight in the arms. i'm right between a small and medium, i wish i would have ordered the medium.","Intimate"
"Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.","Intimate"
"Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it.","Intimate"
"Reviews said it ran small so i ordered a size up, was large on me. nicely made, but wanted something a little smaller.","Intimate"
"This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it, styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortless/chic so cal look. love that pop of hot pink too! i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders. overall this is a great summer top!","Intimate"
"I am beyond pleased with this dress. photos do not do it justice and no, it does not look like a gown. it is comfortable, forgiving, and will be a staple for years to come. i am 5' 11"" and the large worked perfectly for me in length and size. this is my first maxi dress and i'm thrilled. do not miss this piece, it is special!","Intimate"
"I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.","Intimate"
"The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it, cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress, it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back, i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!

wearing this to south beach, it will be perfect with strappy, high heels.","Intimate"
"This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!","Intimate"
"Such a beautiful top, i understand why other reviews suggested wearing it out. personal i love pretty sleepwear, so i will be wearing this and matching shorts to bed. i ordered a small in both and they seem to run true to size. i am 130lbs and 5'5"". my regular size is small or a size 4. i love the embroidery and the pink!","Intimate"
"The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it, and a slip dress underneath. this way, the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture, or left ope","Intimate"
"This dress looked great on the hanger, but once on, it did absolutely nothing for me.

navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.

i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses, but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher","Intimate"
"I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.","Intimate"
"This lounge robe is the most fantastic, dramatic and comfortable wrap dress!  to the reviewers who posted pictures--you styled this to perfection.   a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured.  i purchased the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd and 140#.","Intimate"
"Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.","Intimate"
"This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am 5 foot two and it comes to my knee","Intimate"
"The only draw back are the slits on the side. they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks. i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it.","Intimate"
"I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!","Intimate"
"Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.","Intimate"
"Unfortunately, the other reviews were accurate. i thought i could still make it work because i loved the design. but alas the dress is incredibly see-through. i tried using it like a bathing suit cover up, unbuttoned, like one of the models shows - but it looked very strange. would have definitely kept this dress for the beach if it weren't completely see-through.","Intimate"
"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.","Intimate"
"The pattern on this dress is even more beautiful in person. as reviewers mention, the dress is sheer, but a nude slip underneath is an easy fix. can't wait to pack this dress for my next beach getaway!","Intimate"

"This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.","Intimate"
"Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.","Intimate"
"This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10"" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium","Intimate"
"It's cute. it works with jeans, linen pants, flip flops. but i wouldn't say it is a ""must have"". but i'm keeping it because it works!","Intimate"
"The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up, but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine), but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely, unique beach dress, this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!","Intimate"
"I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.","Intimate"
"This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer, but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!","Intimate"
"I already have this in white. i wear it all the time and get tons of compliments because it's so unusual. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because my white one is a large petite and this one was not available in petite (i bought a m). i'm 5'2"", 135lbs and am a little thick in the middle so the large petite gave me that extra room. this material is stretchy though so i am able to kind of pull on the sides to widen it a bit. i put it in the dryer and it shrunk a little in length too. th","Intimate"

"I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.","Intimate"
"I am happy with my decision to buy this dress! it's casual, comfortable and my favorite color, too. this product is true to size, color and the material feels great.","Intimate"
"I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors","Intimate"

"When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.","Intimate"
"This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans, classic denim, this fall, maybe with a jacket over. 
i purchased a size medium, and it is loose and comfortable.","Intimate"
"This dress is more of a lounge dress for at home even a belt and nice shoes would. it make it ok for day. 5$2 back is way longer than the front, more so than shown in the picture and the material is not substantial but for a lounge dress or swim
coverup it is fine.","Intimate"
"I gave only 4 stars because i really wish the fabric was not so sheer. unless you are very unmodest, you will need to wear a slip. 
i am 6 feet and it hits just above my ankle. slits on side and front. i know it is 'supposed to' be use as a beach cover-up..but forgot that! this is way too pretty not to wear out at night(with a slip {:>). 
i am not a fan of the tie waist, so i at wear a belt to cover it. 
overall, i recommend. enjoy!","Intimate"
"I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person, i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent, and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.","Intimate"
"This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.","Intimate"
"I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it!  it is ""diaphanous,"" but that is the intended look.  the dress is meant to be a cool, breezy, cover-up.  the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves, but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with.  anyway, i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit.  i left this dress behind, but kept thinking about how very pretty it was.  when retailer offered an addit","Intimate"

"I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted ""just another cover-up"". in the final analysis, even at $35 (30% off 49.99), it just hung there. if that's what you're after, then this is for you.","Intimate"
"This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.","Intimate"
"The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!","Intimate"
"I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn't bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i'm 5' 9"" tall), 32d chest. i liked it, it was comfortable, but i just couldn't decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end, i d","Intimate"

"The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous, but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small, which is unreal, since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite, height-wise, but more than length, there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely, though, so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!","Intimate"

"I love this top. it is very comfortable and great to throw on with a tank and jeans for the weekend. i am curvy, and the drape of the top works well on my frame. i could see using it as a gym coverup as shown, but i like the top too much to get sweat on it :)","Intimate"
"This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyone's closet. great for layering.","Intimate"
"I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!","Intimate"
"This tank is perfect. it fits close to the body, but does not squeeze. it is super soft, smooth, and comfy. it layers perfectly under blouses. this is by far my favorite basic tank!","Intimate"
"The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.","Intimate"
"I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them, but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!","Intimate"
"I bought this in my usual size small.  it is really light and airy--very pretty.  as the other reviewer noted, it is longer in front and shorter in the back.  the back hit my waistband, as it does on the model in the picture.  it hid my bra very well (always a plus).  i wouldn't describe the fabric as soft and i did get a static electricity issue, but the top stayed put.  overall, very pleased.","Intimate"

"These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.","Intimate"
"These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.","Intimate"
"Overall: soft material, cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right. 

fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a, than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad","Intimate"

"A very pretty pair of over-the-knee socks. i purchased the dark grey color, which has a metallic silver thread running through it. a nice subtle but glitzy touch. the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done. i'm 5' 4"" and they do come up well above the knee. if you are walking quite a bit, they don't stay above the knee, but they do seem to stay just below the knee. because the yarn is fairly thin they don't look bunchy even if they come down a bit. i have very sensitive skin, and metallics","Intimate"

"I love this romper! i wear it as lounge wear around the house and to bed. it shows a bit more skin than i'd be comfortable showing in public but perfect for around the house. i'm usually a medium but it hung on me weird so i sized down and it's absolutely perfect!  love the color, the fabric and how it falls just right and the ultra softness is heavenly.","Intimate"
"This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out","Intimate"
"Love this and wish it came in more colors. the fabric and cut are so comfortable. i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash. washed and then air dried but put in dryer for 15 mins to speed up drying process. i'm 5'7"" so it's already short but now i'll probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house. super cute though and great price with sale on sale!","Intimate"
"This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!","Intimate"
"This romper is sooo comfortable and cute! it is definitely pretty casual, and probably best used as a beach cover up, as it exposes a lot of skin. that being said, i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine. as far as sizing, i usually order a small, and got this in a small and it fit perfectly.","Intimate"
"I love love love this swimsuit! yes it's a bit pricey for a bathing suit, but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing. i can't wait to wear it in hawaii next month! the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off, i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident. overall a great swimsuit for the summer!","Intimate"
"Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for ""active"" wear.","Intimate"
"I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it, however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever, though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4"" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me, and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky, which it does mention. maybe a little expensive, but i did use a coupon.","Intimate"
"Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6"" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium.","Intimate"
"I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming, and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned, and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also, it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!","Intimate"

"I like this robe a lot. the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful. i like the soft interior-but wish it went all the way down the arms. the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hood-the arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozy.

i do not think the robe is necessarily flattering, in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming, it is more of a cozy-around-the-house robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath.","Intimate"
"I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.","Intimate"

i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!

two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look.","Intimate"

"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.","Intimate"
"Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.","Intimate"
"I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable, but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it, but i'm not sure what would work based on the style, and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.","Intimate"

"I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans, but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.","Intimate"
"This suit is really flattering and comfortable. i love the pattern and the removable strap. the only downside is the top of the suit folds down easily showing the lining at the top. this has been the case with other suits i've bought from retailer, but it's so flattering that i can live with that flaw.","Intimate"
"I loved the design of this suit. the zigzag pattern is great at covering up any tummy issues but the print is still fun and not frumpy. i got a compliment the first day i wore it. it is a great one piece that gives great coverage and yet is still fun. the only thing i don't like about the suit is that the top of the suit slips over showing the lining. i read this in other reviews and it is true. while that is annoying, i liked the suit enough to keep it.","Intimate"
"Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.","Intimate"
"This was my first shot at high-rise bottoms and i love them. the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable. i just bought the bottoms so i can't comment on the top, it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match.","Intimate"
"I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet, the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i'm keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt.","Intimate"
"The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).","Intimate"
"I wish this came in a petite size! i'm going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i'm busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium.","Intimate"
"I do agree with others that the draping does sit a little funny, but its nothing that a simple tack can't fix. this suit looks incredible on, and does a good job of hiding my ""mom pooch"" while still making me feel sexy with the cutouts. also covers the chest area well.","Intimate"

"I am so love in this top, i wish i had it in all colors and will absolutely be watching the sale rack for these ones. i love this top. i work out at a gym that requires tops, but that means i cannot usually display my awesome sports bras with cute strappy backs. this yoga top has an open back which will show these off, which i really like. the draped back keeps you nice and cool also. and the fit is amazing. i have some extra baby belly that i can't seem to work off-it was invisible in this top.","Intimate"
"I absolutely love this suit and was very disappointed to have to return it! it is really well made and the fabric colors/design is beautiful in person. unfortunately it just did not fit my body type. i am athletic build with a smaller chest and thicker behind, 120lbs, 5'4. the small was definitely the right size for me, but the back of the suit cut way high up on the butt so that a lot of the rear is exposed, which just did not work well for me. this will work great for someone with a smaller bu","Intimate"

"This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice, i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer, which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra, which too many of this design do. it is a bit large, you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.","Intimate"

"When i saw this slip/nighty on-line i loved it! most of the night-gowns i own are from retailer and i am very pleased with them. i ordered my normal size small and it fit well. for reference i am 5' 1"" and 120lbs, 35c. the only slight issue is that the fabric is quite sheer, not a big deal since one is wearing this item to sleep in, but it would have been better in my opinion if it wasn't so see-through. also this may not matter to anyone but the stitching along the top is a bright neon pin","Intimate"

"I just received this swimsuit today and love it!  i was a little hesitant to order with the cutouts, but i feel it is very flattering.
i was choosing between an xs and s.  i ended up going with xs and am glad i did, i think going up would of caused gaping on the sides.

first, it is way too short for me, especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay, to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also, the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th","Intimate"

"Very pretty, romantic","Intimate"
"Love this top! it's very simple modern design can go with many different bottoms and the soft pink color gives it a slight distinction from a plain white tank. love it!","Intimate"
"I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!","Intimate"
"Fits nicely, casual and lightweight for the summer and i like the look of the cross straps in the back. no complaints!","Intimate"
"This is a really soft, nice, summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back, as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach, but not in a trash-baggy way. 

it mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn't leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal, not large -- and usually wear a small. i've found that the top button buttons fine, and looks good when i'm not moving, but it pulls a little when i move around","Intimate"
"Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better","Intimate"
"Fits well, super soft and very flattering. great for layering and for dressing up or down. highly recommend!","Intimate"

"I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.","Intimate"
"This was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it. top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area. runs small. i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit.","Intimate"
"I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.","Intimate"
"I decided to order both the black & sand colors in the m/l. very soft & fit is perfect. has adjustable straps. wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk. the bra & straps were not exposed. it did not rub or irritate at all. it will work well under other tops i have & some dresses that are racerback style. i have other racerback bras but they just haven't worked out - either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways. this one is perfect! it's soft & lightweight. it has some moderate","Intimate"
"""vegan suede"" makes these sound fancier than they are. i love them and they're super cozy and a nice change from plain leggings, but they're just a microfiber legging which makes the price about 20 too high even for retailer. still... i'm sure i'll wear them plenty. i usually wear a 2-4 and the xs fit me, which makes me think they'd be too large for a size 0/xs.","Intimate"
"I am wearing these as i type this. they are unbelievably cozy. would wear them as loungewear if it weren't for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out. so soft and a really good fit. higher than my other leggings so i don't have to pull them up ever. but also just really fashionable looking. love!!! one of my favorite retailer purchases ever.","Intimate"

"Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight, i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely, so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.","Intimate"
"I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.","Intimate"
"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab, keeps you warm or cool as appropriate, doesn't ride up, and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down, but once you do, you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age, middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes, and in this cami, i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more, but the later gives m","Intimate"

"Maxi dresses are always my summer staple and moss has been my favorite wardrobe color lately, so this dress was a must buy! i'm petite and this came about two inches above my feet. i would be cautious if you're more chesty, i wear a c cup and typically am a 0/2 at retailer, but the extra small's bust line didn't hit under my bust properly and was too high up. i'm hoping sizing up will fix the problem if the small comes back in stock online. besides sizing issues on my part this dress was nice and","Intimate"

"I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle","Intimate"

i'm not sure what kind of bra to wear if any but it it fits so nicely around my bust line that it looks tasteful.","Intimate"
"I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5"" 1 1/2"" ,135 lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!","Intimate"
"I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support, it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said, selling this as ""one size fits all"" is misleading, at best.  i'm 5'2, ~160 (a lot of it muscle, but i enjoy chorizo), a 34ddd, and this fit me perfectly, but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium.

"This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!","Intimate"
"These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure","Intimate"
"I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color, slightly heathered.

what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.

i wore the tank out and about, and it was comfy and pretty. later, though, my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough, it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time, i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit","Intimate"
"I own this tank in three different colors, and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft, good quality, and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase, and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on, just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.","Intimate"

"I saw these in the connecticut retailer but didn't want to pay full price. the very next week, they went on sale! i ordered xs (i'm 5'4, small frame, 120lbs). while the length is perfect, the waist is a bit tight for pjs. though, not tight enough to return as i love everything else about these. they're like wearing a painting of fine art! light weight flannel. hope they hold up well iin cold water wash!","Intimate"
"This hoodie is beautiful, soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality, and they've always said i could bring it back)","Intimate"
"It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.","Intimate"
"I saw this in my local retailer, and was blown away by how soft it was! the minute i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off. for being a boxy cut, it was surprisingly flattering. i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes, but i could easily zip the size large all the way up. this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend, or with a pretty blouse on under it at work. i know i'll get a ton of use out of it, so i recommend it!","Intimate"
"I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!","Intimate"

"Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.","Intimate"
"This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.","Intimate"
"I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.","Intimate"
"I am 5' 4"", a size 8-10 (size 29/30), and my figure is apple-ish. i can't pull off peplum tops because they are too tight for my shape and they flare out at an unflattering spot. all of those ""rules"" go out the window with this tankini.

first, swimsuits are supposed to be tight, so that problem is eliminated right away.
second, the flare-out is perfect for women that want to hide their tummies. i don't like how swimsuits are generally tight in the tummy - that's the area that i'd like to hide t","Intimate"

"Swimsuit shopping can be the worst. it's difficult to find bathing suits that fit well and are flattering. this swim top is a winner. the straps are comfortable, and the scoop in the front was not too low for a 36d cup. the best part is the higher back! a lot of swimwear dips in the back, but this does not (read: eliminates the dreaded back fat). my only concern was that it isn't super supportive for larger busts, but i'm keeping it because i love the straps and how it flatters overall. this wou","Intimate"

the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater.","Intimate"
"These are cute, comfy and just as pictured; a soft greenish-gray but i didn't find them to be super flattering on me, or at least not slimming in my view. i'm 5'3"" about 105 lbs., and got them in s/m which fit just right, but they do go all the way up to my true waist. they are ""tube legs"", meaning they're not contoured tights. so there's excess fabric at the toe (it'd be all bunched in flats) and there's a tiny bit of looseness at the ankle. there's also no distinguishable front or back (and no","Intimate"

"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i","Intimate"
"The fit is gorgeous, but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical.","Intimate"
"This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that's actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you're wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size.","Intimate"
"My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower, and of all the lingerie i received that day, this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.","Intimate"
"This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.","Intimate"
"While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)","Intimate"
"I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to","Intimate"

"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came","Intimate"

"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic.","Tops"

"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the","Tops"

"As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.","Tops"
"I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!","Tops"
"Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.","Tops"
"I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.","Tops"
"This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.","Tops"
"The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.","Tops"
"I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!","Tops"
"I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.","Tops"
"I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.","Tops"

"This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.","Tops"
"I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11"", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges.","Tops"

"This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.","Tops"
"This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.","Tops"

"The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!","Tops"
"An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.","Tops"

"I really did not need another coat at all, but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy,something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft, cozy and fluid, but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks, to a football game, or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -","Tops"

"I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.

the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming","Tops"

"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it.

one concern: since the wool is light","Tops"
"Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination.

"At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.

"Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.","Tops"
"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great.

if you don't have as much mass in the arms, get the xs. if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms, it's better to go with the small.","Tops"

"I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work (quite often). i came across this top, but had never seen it before it was put on sale. i was intrigued by the sleeves, but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate. i was happily surprised when i tried it on. the fabric was thick, which i find highlights curves and hides rolls. the detail was enough that i could dress it up, but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans.","Tops"

"This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy, yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent, but with a tank, it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty","Tops"

"This is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies. i purchased the gray colorway. i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews. the xs is still pretty loose on me, but i don't mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway. the color is so pretty and the design is edgy. it will transition to fall well.","Tops"

"This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.","Tops"
"I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in","Tops"

"I love this vest, bought it in green and want to order white. its very flattering, and i wore it with a black tank top, ripped faded stevie cropped jeans, and gold gladiators. i would like to mention the care. i dripped something on the lapel, so i tried cleaning it off with a wet towel. it made a lighter mark, so i washed as recommended in cold water on gentle in the machine. i hung it to dry, and it dried stiff and a little wrinkled so i threw it in the dryer to soften it up. it lightened up a","Jackets"
"I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.

i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo","Jackets"

"Great casual jacket! it's a nice spring weight, can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs, folding the collar, wrapping or unwrapping, etc. i love the way they styled it in the model shots. i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts. i have to say the medium was so oversized, it looked like i was wearing a fabric box. i have a broad back and 36ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs.","Jackets"
"Don't be put off by the sparkle! this jacket is amazing. lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches. i love this retailer in house brand, elevenses. i take a medium in this brand( 8/10) and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer. i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small -small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small. but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel. i have a 34 dd chest as reference. i plan to wear this in spring","Jackets"

"This coat is super cute and flattering. i am 5&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;8&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; and it comes almost to my knee on the back. i&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;m usually a small but got the medium in case i wear a bulky sweater underneath. comfy and warm, but won&amp;amp;amp;#39;t be warm enough when winter hits without a big sweater underneath. great to throw on to walk the dog or hit the bus stop in style.","Jackets"
"I really love this coat! it is beautiful and very comfortable. while the attached scarf does cover the cute buttons, i'm glad it is there! it comes in handy when the temperature drops quicker than anticipated. the only thing missing on this coat is a lining as soft as the exterior.","Jackets"
"Been searching for a denim ""trucker"" jacket since last fall and was happy to see that retailer had this in stock, purchased it online without thinking twice. typically, due to my small upper frame, i'm 5'4, 130lbs, 34 a for referance, i'm between a size small and an xs. bought both and opted for the size small when it arrived. 
i love the fit, slightly cropped in the back and i also like how it""s lined inside. great quality and perfect for fall!","Jackets"
"I purchased this jacket and the levis sherpa denim jacket for comparison. i chose this one over the levi's jacket as this one had more shape/curve to the bodice, which i wanted. i am usually a small but needed a medium in this jacket-- i have wider shoulders, 34c chest, 28"" waist, 38"" hip, 5' 4"" 120lbs.","Jackets"

"I got this jacket after being inspired by the looks from stranger things, and love that the fuzzy collar style is coming back! i tend to wear medium shirts and large jackets/coats to fit my long arms, and the sleeves are a great length for me. the lining has a gorgeous pattern on the inside too. the buttons were difficult to button at first, but became easier over time as the fabric softened. i also bought a pilcro skirt and it's comfortable too, so overall i&#39;m very happy with this brand.","Jackets"
"This vest is a stunner! the dark brown suede is so beautiful. the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest. it's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch. yes, it is a little pricey but it's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too. it's a keeper!!!","Jackets"

"If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat, i would end up writing a book. this coat is beautiful, fits like a glove. i got the size 4, went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the 4 and 6. i'm typically a 2, so i guess i went a size up. this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful.","Jackets"
"Love this coat. the colour is vibrant and it is well made. it does however run small. for me it was two sizes. i am usually a 00p and ended up purchasing the 2p. glad i tried it on in a store. it is a good spring/fall coat as it is lightweight. if i had purchased the 4p i could layer it a bit more. good but though. just be sure to size up.","Jackets"

"I agree with the other reviewer, the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.","Jackets"
"Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it, and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great, drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape, but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.","Jackets"

"I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person, however, this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body,and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore), and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall, too. great","Jackets"
"I love, love this trench! i bought the grey, and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!

it does run a little big, but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!

"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets, but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2"" , 120 lbs., but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips, but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled, but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!","Jackets"
"I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!","Jackets"
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.","Jackets"
"Absolutely love this jacket.initially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket, which looks similar to this one, and tried them both on in store. the latter just didn't drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me, but this piece is amazing! it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look. the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacket,middle bottom, which is a bit of an added but subtle flair, the color is a bit more 't","Jackets"

"I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik","Jackets"
"Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!","Jackets"
"I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.","Jackets"
"This is the perfect throw on little blazer-like jacket that feels like a sweatshirt! i loved it so much (on sale) that i bought another one in a different color. i am 5'0'' and 115lbs and the xs fits like a glove. it is so great. well made. so comfortable. versatile. dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans.","Jackets"
"I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work. it's basically a blazer/sweatshirt hybrid!

while it does run true to size, i can wear a small or medium in retailer; i purchased medium in this. don't size down if your size is ambiguous!","Jackets"
"I love lightweight coat-jackets, of which this is a great example. they effortlessly pull an outfit together and give real personality to simple staples. the unstructured linen, while indeed lined, gives this coat a casual drape for spring/summer. i see it paired with bright red joggers and a white t, with chambray or white linen pants, even as a chic beach cover-up. i un-tacked the cuffs to give the sleeves a simpler look, but it's decidedly day and casual as opposed to evening or work wear. fu","Jackets"
"This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen, stripes, pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p","Jackets"

"This coat is beautifully tailored and made in the usa of 100% wool the color is vibrant. it looks great when you need a longer coat for the cold. it's almost an outfit on its own. lastly, the size was perfect. i ordered my normal 8 and it fit like a glove.","Jackets"
"This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs,","Jackets"
"Ordered this in my typical size, xs, and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis, but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus, there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral, brown that should go with almost anything.","Jackets"

"Great little summer jacket that takes the place of a jean jacket . i am not usually fond of olive green but this is a bit deeper than a drab olive without being too green. it is sooo soft and comfortable that i find i am pairing it with all sorts of outfits. fits tts if you are going for the look on the model- not too fitted.
i highly recommend this timeless piece.","Jackets"
"This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an ""easy"" look. i've already worn this with a dress, and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6"", 138 lbs and took a medium.","Jackets"

it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.","Jackets"

"Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.","Jackets"
"This jacket is well made and the fit is perfect. it is quilted and will work well three seasons of the year. it goes with jeans, cords and flannel, and would work with skirts and dresses. colors are a bit more muted and darker than my display shows, but only slightly. studs and black trim really punch up the look of this jacket. i am very pleased with it!","Jackets"

"This vest is adorable! i love the color, it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great, some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly, i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall, but it works perfectly with my build.","Jackets"
"I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.","Jackets"

"Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.","Jackets"
"I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back didn't fall too long. it runs true to size. it's soft and i wear it with long dresses, rompers, short dresses, skirts. it's a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it's fine.","Jackets"
"I bought this as a ""reward."" i have wanted a leather jacket forever and i truly love this. goes with so many things; tons of compliments. soft, comfortable material.","Jackets"
"This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!","Jackets"
"This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!","Jackets"
"This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer, i have this in a small and it fits perfectly, fits snug when zipped, my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!","Jackets"
"This vest is super cute on. it definitely has kept me warm this winter.","Jackets"
"I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...","Jackets"
"Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy, which i like. absolutely fabulous!","Jackets"
"This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive, it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value, is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and, in addition to looking great does keep you warm.","Jackets"
"The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.","Jackets"
"I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.","Jackets"
"I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.","Jackets"
"This jacket is perfect for fall! lightweight and easily worn over other tops or layers. looks great with jeans!","Jackets"
"Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight, it's back, and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made, can go from business to sport to casual.","Jackets"
"This jacket is a perfect, lightweight cover for dresses as shown online, but will also look great with jeans and tops. the embroidery looks amazing and is high quality. the tie in the back can make the shirt a little more form-fitted. while its a masculine style, its has feminine details and fit. this is my third hei hei jacket, the sizes between them are consistent (i'm 5'4'', 125lbs. 34c and i wear an xs in this jacket) - each one i've worn a million times!","Jackets"
"This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy, comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.","Jackets"
"At 46 years old, i still like fun, hip, fashionable items, but i don't want to look like i raided my 21 year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!","Jackets"
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly with just a bra on underneath, when zipped up. i plan on wearing tank tops or thin t-shirts under it, and leaving it unzipped. i'm normally a size 10, but at retailer, i'm a 12 in their jackets.

2. thin with a thin lining, but stiff enough to hold its shape. the front zipper also helps give firmness to the front edge.

3. the fabric is white with lots of beige embroidery and lace holes.

"I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.","Jackets"
"I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!","Jackets"
"Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading - wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt & jeans and got compliments left and right - love it!!","Jackets"
"This jacket is far more attractive than on the website. i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store. the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich, olive green background. blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments. i am 5'1, 110 lbs. and the extra small regular fit fine. i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w","Jackets"
"A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.","Jackets"

"This coat is gorgeous. the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type!
when it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every way.
the lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flattering.
i have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautiful.
a must for retailer shoppers. 
i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection.","Jackets"
"This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned. nice soft material. i have a steamer so won't have to iron this, depends on how picky you'd be about that. great cut. ordered my normal size. sending another jacket back that luckily i hadn't worn yet. i know between the two, i will always pick this one. didn't find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option. seriously so excited to wear this. :)","Jackets"
"Couldn't resist this jacket! it's perfect for business casual dress code, for staying warm in air-conditioned offices and goes with many colors and styles.

many times jackets are too tight on my shoulders or not long enough for my arms and this fits perfectly. (i'm 5' 7"" and i bought a medium)","Jackets"
"I have not written a review for an retailer item in a while. i have been shopping at retailer for over ten years. in the past two years the clothing i have purchased has been disappointing in style and quality. but not this little pilcro jacket. great quality, perfectly proportioned, great understated details. many thanks retailer for restoring my faith.","Jackets"
"I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous, but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4, 5'5"" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it.","Jackets"
"Great fit, can be dressy or casual, goes with everything, i adore tis jacket!","Jackets"
"Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim. looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants","Jackets"
"What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.","Jackets"
"Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.","Jackets"
"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!","Jackets"
"Coat is very soft and comfortable. runs large; usually wear an xsp, could have gone with an xxsp, if it came in that size. the lining is very soft. can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath, if needed.
some small, little pulls on outside fabric, but, might be part of the fabric. outside fabric is very soft. would not have paid full price; glad it was on sale, as i had been eyeing it for some time. it is cute, and felt like twirling, when put it on!","Jackets"
"Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend","Jackets"
"I love the colorblock color combo. the colors are neutral enough to go with so many things yet still be unique and stand out. the fit was perfect. i took my normal size medium.","Jackets"

"Love this vest! saw it and bought it instantly. i'm 5'8"" and slim and got the xs. it fits perfectly. there is a lot of ""puff"" to it, but it's really warm and soft.","Jackets"
"120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me, i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.","Jackets"
"This anorak is perfection! perfect weight, color, and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5""3, 130lbs, 32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!","Jackets"

"I'm 5'3, i ordered the petite (nice to have this option), the length/volume doesn't overwhelm me as some kimonos do. this feels more like a fall-season kimono due to the fabric content. it is not a wispy fabric, there's weight and some stiffness to the drape, you can see on the model how the fabric stands away from her body. it's a different look from silky feeling kimonos that hug the body. a rich blend of blue, black, white, subtle tan, maybe some silver grey - hard to tell, the colors look li","Jackets"
"Agree with other reviewers the jacket is better in person than on model very nice jacket model does it no justice","Jackets"
"I love this blazer. its perfect for work, and makes a great statement.","Jackets"
"Love the simple, casual elegance of this coat. i especially love the colors, grey & beige, because it looks great with my grey jeans as well as my dressier beige pants. i will get a lot of use from this coat.","Jackets"
"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.","Jackets"
"First saw the jacket online and liked it so i went to the store to check out. the color looks nicer in person.  it fitted me really well and looked really nice on me. the jacket is very soft and well made.  the only thing is the sleeves are a little longer but not a big deal. can't wait to wear it when the full is here!","Jackets"
"I am absolutely in love with this piece! yes it runs large. i'm usually a medium to large in vests ands the small fits me prefectly! the quality is superb. i love the feel of the faux fur, i want to pet it! and the snaps and hooks seem as if they will also last forever. thank you tracy!","Jackets"

"Love this vest!. it does run large so definitely size down. i'm 5'0, 110 lbs and i ordered the xs which is roomy around the mid section but i think that's the style as the shoulders hit where they should. it is such a fun and unique piece. i cannot wait to wear it with tights or black leggings with boots.","Jackets"
"Fun and elegant!
this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials, as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.
it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! it is comfortable to wear","Jackets"
"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey, and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference, i ordered my normal size xs (5'5, 115 lbs, muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves, but i still think there would be adequate room.","Jackets"
"This is an amazing jacket! it fits perfectly through the shoulders, with enough give to make it comfortable. i love the color and the feel of it, as well. it will be perfect for the spring and summer evenings.","Jackets"
"Absolutely love this jacket - soft, nice amount of stretch, and the fit is beautiful. i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too (motos are sometimes tricky for me). totally cute and versatile - worth full price!","Jackets"
"I love this jacket. it has great structure and lays nicely, while still have knit arms and a lining. don't try this on if you aren't prepared to buy it because it's amazing. color is more of an olive than a khaki to me as it appears in this picture. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly. definitely consider this as an investment piece across many seasons.","Jackets"
"Ordered this jacket in the holly color thinking it would be brown per the photo but when it arrived it was more olive green. it is a beautiful, well-made jacket but i already have two olive green jackets?don?t need a third. if they bring this jacket out in brown i will definitely order. i order the xs and it fit perfectly.","Jackets"
"Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.","Jackets"
"I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured, i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.
i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer. 
this jacket runs smaller, the sleeves were very tight , and overall it was just too small. had to return it.","Jackets"
"This brand makes the best jackets. i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket. both fit amazing. this one is no different. it fits great!! love that it's a great casual jacket with structure and drape. i can't say enough good things about this jacket. every time i wear it, i feel so pulled together. fun light gray color that you don't see too often in jackets. this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come. must have.","Jackets"
"First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas, but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall, if you're considering this jacket, take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.","Jackets"
"I loved this jacket it is very cute until i washed it! i followed the care instructions and it still does not wash well. the arms shrank about half an inch making them a little short, i have been rolling them up","Jackets"
"This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months. i love it! i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color. luckily it is more of a green beige. it is a very flattering jacket and yes, you do want to size up. this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i don't want to take it off. i am 5'5"", 34 b and the medium fits great!","Jackets"
"I am really impressed with the workmanship of this jacket as well as the ""fit."" it really does fit me well and has a ""cool"" look. the quality is really worth the price. thank you retailer!!","Jackets"
"I saw this in store, but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however, i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans, but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.","Jackets"

"I purchased this jacket on pure impulse. to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear, and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on. my goodness it's perfect. it's slightly oversized, delightfully 70's and makes everything look good skirts, pants, dresses etc. buy it, especially off the 70's have a special place in your heart.","Jackets"

"I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it's warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.","Jackets"
"I have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me. i like the way this fits and it doesn't pull when i try to cross my arms in front. i feel like it's good quality and hopefully won't flake the way 'vegan' (i.e. fake) leather can. and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile. i also like the length that hits right at my hip. i'm 5'2"" and don't like when jackets like this are are too long.","Jackets"

"Love this jacket! it is incredibly soft and expensive looking. i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured. i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great. this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up.","Jackets"

"This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim, but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior, the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.","Jackets"
"I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.","Jackets"

"This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didn't because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea","Jackets"

"I'm not a blazer girl but this one is perfect in the sense that it's not overly structured and stiff. it is really soft and comfortable but still holds it's shape. i am planning to wear it with a tee shirt and denim or even some leather leggings (pilcro).i can see this being dressed up for work or church. a great piece for your wardrobe. i could have taken a small but decided on the medium in case i wore something a little thicker underneath.","Jackets"
"I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.","Jackets"
"I am currently studying at a university where i am constantly reviewed on how i dress. if i'm underdressed i get comments and if i'm overdressed i get even more comments. the other day i wore a plain navy blue blazer and people asked me all day what the occasion was. for me, this blazer is a nice solution to the standard uniform blazer. the stripes and light grey color make this blazer more casual for me, but i still feel put together for class. the fit is also excellent and doesn't feel boxy at","Jackets"
"Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer. i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect. i love its simple lines, softness, and quality of the material. it transitions easily from work to casual. i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful.","Jackets"
"This has become a go-to work staple in my closet. soft, with a relaxed fit, makes this a very easy piece to work the day away in while still pulling off a dressy casual appropriate for my office. highly recommend","Jackets"

"This jacket is a neutral color with a subtle print that adds great character. the stitching around the edges is cute. the shape is very flattering and not too boxy as some open jackets can be. a perfect layering piece!","Jackets"
"This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy","Jackets"
"This is a beautiful coat. no one has mentioned how beautifully the pattern matches, even across the arms coordinating with the front. i love the lower button as it allows for arm movement and contributes to the casual slouch. the only complaint i have is there is a slight dark spot above both pockets. this appears to be a sewer's mark for placement. i think i have figured out how to disguise it without marring the fabric; but second item from retailer with marks (quality control?). i am keeping th","Jackets"
"I'm in love, i'm in love, and i don't care who knows it. i bought this vest on a whim and i'm so glad i did. it's so soft and cozy. the medium brown color makes it highly versatile as well. i've tried the faux fur vests and they are too bulky for my taste, but this was not bulky at all. warm and hangs well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame and the small was just right. try this vest on...i promise you will be in love!","Jackets"
"Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.","Jackets"
"This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.

*highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.","Jackets"
"Love this coat. it fits very well - i'm 5'6"" and typically wear an 8. it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention, but that's part of its tailored look. this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit. so happy with this purchase.","Jackets"
"I have had my eye on this coat for a while and then my size (0) was sold out. when it popped back i ordered it. i am 5'4"" and i had wondered if i needed the petite (petite 0 was sold out) because of all the reviews i had read. however, the sleeve length is perfect. in a petite, the sleeves would be too short. i don't have long arms so i am surprised some reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long. the button placement is not at the waist but that is the style! the lapels are long","Jackets"
"I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue. i tend to gravitate toward dark colors, but this looked timeless and beautiful, like something my grandmother would have cherished (and i would have coveted). i was not disappointed. the coat is carefully lined, and the mohair is divinely soft. the silhouette is not fitted, but comes off surprisingly chic. do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather; i've even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la. also, heed t","Jackets"
"This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater, (which is fabulous,) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures, the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say, i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!","Jackets"
"This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it, even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous, you don't see coats like this on the street, not a cookie-cutter. it's very soft, yet warm, and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed.
it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 (","Jackets"
"Google ""mr burns see my vest"". because that's me wearing this vest, dancing around the house singing because this vest is wonderful. my three year old nephew declared it ""cozy"" and anytime i wear it he cuddles up to the vest. bonus! it's flattering, comfortable, warm, machine washable, and goes with nearly everything. i would like a onesie made of this material.","Jackets"
"I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite, and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes, the button is low, but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise, the fit may be completely off.","Jackets"
"This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room, so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so, so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.","Jackets"
"This windowpane coat is so striking -- and it looks even better on than in the photos. i love it!! it has great styling, including the button placement & the beautiful fall brown lining. it is quite warm over a thin sweater, the fabric is amazingly soft. i get a lot of compliments on it! two friends have already purchased it. i normally might take a 12, but a 10 was just fine. this is a great coat!!","Jackets"
"I must be the lone dissenter, but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp, as it does run wide. however, with skinny jeans or slim pants, this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone, but it's one of my faves right now.","Jackets"
"This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms, so i think for everyone else, your normal jacket size should be perfect.","Jackets"
"I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6"" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me 2 inches below my knee. i love it.","Jackets"
"I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's","Jackets"
"I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area, however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.","Jackets"
"I had my eye on this jacket (in moss) for awhile. i was afraid the vegan leather wouldn't feel natural or soft but i was wrong. it's wonderfully soft - so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone it's vegan leather, they feel compelled to touch it and can't get over the quality. the detailing is great and the back adds a special, interesting touch. it's become my go-to jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress. and who doesn't love getting a compliment every","Jackets"
"This jacket feels like quality and has beautiful detailing. one thing to note though, the proportions are a little odd - it is cut very high in the back (at the waist) and the sleeves seem over-long.","Jackets"
"This is the one. the faux fur i have been looking for. it is plush and heavy so that it should keep me warm and toasty during the dreaded new england winter. i love the richly saturated jewel tones over a base of black . there are only two snaps to close the front but there is enough fabric to overlap to keep the cold away. maybe winter won't be so bad after all....
one caveat is that the item description is not truly accurate.

"But tight around the chest, i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area, kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic, and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.","Jackets"
"My title says it all. this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go. the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere. it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous. i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me. get this before it's gone.","Jackets"
"Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive, but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j","Jackets"
"Tracy reese always pleases. this coat is absolutely awesome. it is gorgeous! the faux fur is soft and cozy. this coat is warm. i love the snap closure. this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days. so happy to have in my wardrobe. a collector's item, for sure.","Jackets"
"I at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style, as i've been looking for spring/fall in-between weather outerwear. but i unexpectedly (and maybe unfortunately for my bank account) fell in love instantly. the fabric is very soft, and the cut is cute, stylish, and flattering. the quality seems good, and the fit is perfect. i ordered an xs regular in the moss color.","Jackets"

"I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful. fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in it!

"I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful, as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey, but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it, it's well worth it.","Jackets"
"I love this poncho! it is flattering (who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho?) and offers enough room for warm clothes underneath.

it is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated, and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath.","Jackets"
"Yes, it runs a little large - i usually get a s or m in tops, but for this i bought a s. i am 5'2"", 130 lbs, and i did not get the petite- i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture. i went into retailer looking for a dress, and walked out with this vest too - had to have. versatile, stylish, pockets, good quality!","Jackets"
"I fell in love with this poncho at first sight. the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot. i'm a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and it's perfect. long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons. i've worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time.","Jackets"
"Got this poncho for christmas and loved it the moment i got it out of the box!! great quality and looks great cant go wrong with this purchase.","Jackets"
"Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist, but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into). 

it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.","Jackets"
"Like everyone else, i ignored this vest in the store. my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it. it wasn't until  i got home that i discovered its versatility. i got it in the beginning of june so haven't been able to wear it much, but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it. it's classy and can dress up any outfit.","Jackets"
"I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of","Jackets"

"I love this jacket. it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesn't have the silver hardware. instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look. it is not super heavy. it also has a cute blue and white striped lining, which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise. i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to. i generally take an xs or sometimes a s","Jackets"

"I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all, the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy, it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.","Jackets"
"The material is velvety smooth, and not quite so pink as pictured on the website. more of a dusty brown rose. well made, nice fit. flattering on my petite frame. a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit.","Jackets"
"I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist, the lapel doesn't lay flat, but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist, you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.","Jackets"

"I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.","Jackets"

"Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right, not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen, very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.","Jackets"

"I received my coat today. in love! it is so flattering in so many ways. it may not be form fitting, but i love all the details and i'm a sucker for hoods. this is a great fall/winter coat especially if you live in the south. it will probably only work as a late spring/early fall coat for you northern ladies. my only compliant is that the arms are too long, but i'm only 5', so it'll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else.","Jackets"
"I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!","Jackets"
"This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.","Jackets"
"I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket, and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color, it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying, it goes with everything and flatters all body types.","Jackets"

"I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so, i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.","Jackets"
"I saw this a few months back and wanted it then and now i bought it. i missed a few promos but i ended up getting it at full price in a large, my usual size i like in the pilcro denim jacket line. i love pilcro and have several of this brands denim jackets and each one is very special. i love the use of the plaid details. it has a weathered appearance - the denim and my distressed treatments are not too severe, as some reviewers have commented on the ""holes"" . i will say this jacket runs small.","Jackets"
"Denim, faux fur, flannel... hooray! i absolutely love this jacket and i'll wear it all winter (even under my warmer winter coat). i'm 5'6""/130 and usually a 2-4 in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waist/chest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater. it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo... maybe that's the only drawback.","Jackets"

"I have wanted a fleece jacket for ages (for warmth and practicality), but i'm not the sporty type. this is the perfect alternative! i got it in wine and use it over a cardigan and dress or jeans. it is a lovely color and passes as wool. this is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. highly recommended. btw, it runs quite big. i'm generally a medium to large but the small is perfect on me.","Jackets"
"So soft, light and warm! will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat. the wine is beautiful, with a subtle two-tone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside, even though it's just one layer. relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouse.

i'm usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s, which looks less slouchy and more jacket-y on.","Jackets"
"Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.","Jackets"
"What s lovely surprise this jacket/cape/poncho is!  first, it is a substantial piece.  heavier than it appears.  it has an almost faux suede feel to it, with a deliciously lush french terry lining.  it looks and feels very rich.  i bought both colors and was glad i did!  i live on the coast and this will be fantastic over a sweater for morning walks along the shore.  i'm a l/xl and the m/l size is a perfect fit!","Jackets"
"This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion, even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj","Jackets"

"The photos shown here really do not do this bomber jacket justice! the colors of the embroidery are much deeper and richer in person! it is very well made, having no loose threads whatsoever. the retailer store where i bought mine featured this jacket over an ivory color lace blouse and it looked much more stunning than over the darker color that they show it here with. it does run true to size as the other reviewer mentioned too. i took my usual size large. i would say that if you're betwe","Jackets"
"I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers, a light blue tank, off white shirt, tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'4 frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.","Jackets"
"I like the light fabric and embroidery on a otherwise hard look (bomber). feminine can be worn casually with jeans and a t-shirt, or over a dress. lovely on every note. fit: i ordered botih the xxs p and xsp. (had tried on regular xs in store) tried on the xxsp first and kept it (didn't try on xs p). since the fit is loose (bomber) on me i like it a little more fitted. there is enough room for a sweater. 

i am 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist. arms were not too snug either...","Jackets"
"It jacket of the season! this bomber is absolutely perfect. not only is the embroidery beautiful, but it's super comfy as well. it's lightweight, nicely lined, and well made. i only gave it four stars for quality simply because the embroidery could get pulled and frayed if not careful. you should expect that with any silky embroidered fabric however.  i would highly recommend this jacket for any body type.","Jackets"
"The images definitely do not do the jacket justice. the detail is beautiful, and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious.","Jackets"
"This is soft to the touch and just beautiful.
it is a little roomy, but true to size. i love it that way. 
totally on trend for the season","Jackets"
"I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite, it is lovely.  i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out.... remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up.  it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear.  looks great with black under it or off white.... also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season... or cranberry.... you will love it...","Jackets"
"I saw this on one of the gals at my local retailer and fell in love. it is the coolest bomber and i instantly fell for it. i went with my normal l and i will be wearing this all fall and winter long it's just so unique and eye catching","Jackets"
"I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it. i tried on a m, which is my normal size, and a s, which, if clothes are baggy, i'll buy for a more fitted look. the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted, so i bought the m. this is definitely true to size. it has a blousy waist to it, so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket. notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi","Jackets"
"This jacket is a show stopper.  great fabric, beautiful embroidery.  well worth the price.","Jackets"
"I have been a loyal retailer customer for at least 10 years now, so i don't say this lightly; this might be my favorite clothing purchase ever. the overall design is incredible. the feminine detail in the embroidery combined with the traditional bomber style is done so well. i somehow snagged a medium petite and it is absolutely perfect. there is enough room to fit a sweater underneath, but the sleeves and waist are the perfect length! something which is difficult to find at 5'2"". also, i must say","Jackets"
"I loved this classic bomber jacket online and in the brochure sent to my house, so i was thrilled to see it in my local retailer store. i anticipated that i would need a large, but i was wrong. the m fits perfectly! 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 in button-up or fitted tops,and dresses (usually 10) and a m in a loose-fit or knit top.

"I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it!","Jackets"

"This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.","Jackets"
"I pair this jacket with a black pencil skirt and it looks very put together. the embroidery is lovely and well done but the jacket would have been nicer with a polyester lining because it clings a little when you put it on. and it's an awfully heavy jacket for the summer. but overall i love it and how i look in it.  i think it runs true to size.","Jackets"
"This outfit was online for months with no review so i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person. 
it is beautiful, high quality tommy bahama inspired suit. i am 55 so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size 4 or 6. i took a 4 in the blazer and i am typically a high 4 or low 6 in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size. i took the size 8 in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length. they ride a bit lower on my waist an","Jackets"

"I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that, which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer!","Jackets"
"I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome","Jackets"

"This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem","Jackets"
"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm, but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""
definitely worth the purchase on sale.","Jackets"
"Love this blazer - it's a heavy jersey fabric, which is comfortable all day, with no wrinkling. and it has a cute light grey jersey knit trim around the pockets which adds visual interest and keeps it from being a boring navy blazer. the sizing is correct - i wear a 6, and the 6 fits perfectly. it's got a slightly athletic 'boyfriend' fit - it's not boxy, but don't look for a really skinny tight fit around the waste.","Jackets"
"This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything, so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly, without being too heavy.","Jackets"

"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite.","Jackets"
"It was bit on pricey side but it was love at first sight! i couldn't let go after i tried it on..it is soft, lightweight, moves with me, keeps me warm (not just from top up)..it feels silky to the touch and is very versatile and stylish..

runs true to size and it expands a bit the more you wear it ...","Jackets"
"I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it.  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)

i love it.  it's still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50's is the perfect temps for it.  

i rarely say this but i don't think the photos of the coat above do it justice.","Jackets"
"Love this jacket so much! so comfy and great for traveling. i love the fit and the way it wears,","Jackets"
"I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day, about 60 f, with a thin sweater underneath, and it felt comfortable. 

the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7"", 125 lb, got size s). also, i wish the lining was full, not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...

overall, i like it :))","Jackets"
"Great jacket. love that the hoodie insert is removable so i can wear just the outer jacket for work.","Jackets"
"I love this blazer! it's so comfortable! i just wonder if the company makes more ""inserts"" in different fabrics/colors? i'd love to be able to change it up a bit.","Jackets"
"It's a great light jacket for early spring. ideal topper for jeans or denim skirt.","Jackets"
"The pictures online do not do this jacket justice. i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it, even before i tried it on. it's extremely versatile, worn as shown, as a layered look, or the zipped ""liner"" is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer. it's the perfect weight for spring/fall. it's fitted, and so cute. this jacket runs true to size (not large). i usually wear a 4 and the small fit perfectly.","Jackets"
"This jacket is the best. i'm trying to step up my work wardrobe game while still maintaining some personality and this blazer fits the bill. it's soft, structured, and best part: the hoodie insert is removable. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.","Jackets"
"This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!","Jackets"
"I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work, but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes, (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes, but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white, but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small, which fit great.","Jackets"
"This jacket has great style, is really comfortable, and looks good with jeans or nice pants. i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small. the medium is a better fit.","Jackets"
"I love this jacket. i was waiting for it to go on sale, and it did... but only because of the fit.

the style is great and it has a peplum that goes all the way around the back. very different.

however, it runs insanely small. i'm not sure where the others are saying it fits true to size. it does not. typically, i'm a xs or s petite. i wear a 0 or a 2. this jacket i needed a 6 in. very small across the back.","Jackets"
"The only thing i did not like about this jacket was that i could not find it in my size before it sold out! retailer, please bring back another iteration for spring!","Jackets"
"I stalked the website to get this in a pxxs. it runs a tad large. this is a beautiful garment. i receive many, many compliments every time i wear it. in fact, nearly everyone comments on it. it is surprisingly warm for a cape. i love that it works so well over my bulkier sweaters. as others have mentioned, the buttons are a little difficult, but i found that they got easier with multiple wearings. i disagree with the reviewer that feels the collar must be worn up. i actually like the collar down","Jackets"
"Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!","Jackets"
"I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater, which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well","Jackets"
"I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be), but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!","Jackets"
"I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!","Jackets"
"I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.","Jackets"
"Nice fit, very comfortable if you wear a thin shirt underneath.","Jackets"
"I purchased this in purple, and agree with previous reviewers who've mentioned that it looks more casual in person. it can be dressed up with the right accessories, though, and the fabric is really excellent quality, soft and durable. i really like the contrasting plaid back, it's a subtle but fashionable detail.","Jackets"
"I found this in your store and had to have it! i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count!!!! the attention to detail makes this jacket special. i am 5 ft 5 inches 124lbs and a 4fits but a 6 is perfect for a sweater underneath. i actually went back a bought the other color. worth every penny.","Jackets"
"The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.","Jackets"
"I love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors. i'm 5'7"", 120 pounds and bought the size 4 which is perfect. initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the 6 because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders. the 6 was too boxy on me and i'm so glad i went with the 4. it stretched, especially the arms, and fits perfect. i love how i can dress this down (with a graphic tee and jeans) or dress up (with a blouse and cropped black pants).","Jackets"
"This coat is wonderful. it's boxy and drapes really nicely. the colors are beautiful and versitile. i love the pockets. the fabric is sturdy, but not heavy. i have nothing but good things to say about this coat. i had to return it, sadly, since it wasn't flattering on my hourglass shape. (i am 5'6"", 34dd-27-42 and the small fit well) if you're confident enough to hide your waste, go for it. your won't regret it.","Jackets"
"This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down. i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress. i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined. it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small (or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer). the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure. my favorite feature is the oversized","Jackets"
"Love this jacket! this picture shows the sleeves rolled down, but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how you'll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down. however, it is still a fabulous fall coat! it does run slightly large, but it depends on how you want it to fit. i am typically a medium, and i bought the m/l because the xs/s was a little fought in the shoulders. i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre","Jackets"
"Love this jacket. you will definitely want to size down though. i am usually a medium/large, but i was swimming in that size. i opted for the xs/s, and it is perfect.","Jackets"
"This duster is light weight - good for a inside a chilly restaurant, but not really warm enough for cold outdoor winter weather.

really punches up a black on black outfit. polished, artsy, interesting look. runs large. has a feel similar to a swing coat - with less swing.

i've received many compliments on this piece. wear it with confidence - it is on the bold side.","Jackets"
"This coat is a classic! i would wear it every day if it wasn't so distinct. very comfortable, flattering, and stylish.","Jackets"
"I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer's said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.","Jackets"
"Adorable jacket. i ordered the medium (5'4, 135 lbs). sleeves are long and have to roll them up. ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better. pink color is great.","Jackets"
"I love this jacket! works so well with business casual outfits, and the color goes with almost everything! great over blouses or t shirts. by far my favorite purchase in quite a while!","Jackets"
"Received the jacket today -- i love it but because it has no stretch in the material it feels a little snug across the shoulders. i have long arms and it fit perfect for the length. i tried to order the next size to see how it would fit, but it was sold out! i'll keep looking for it to be back in stock.","Jackets"
"Other than the color (i got the rose color), which is great, i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7"" and the sleeves come right to my wrists, if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.","Jackets"
"I was so afraid to get a too-small blazer (based on other reviews) that i ordered this two sizes up. i am usually a 0 or 2 in a blazer and ordered a 4. it was huge. i then ordered a 2 and it is just right. it's comfortable and chic and i love the blue and black combination.","Jackets"
"Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.","Jackets"
"I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on. the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic! love love love the gold buttons. this will look great for work, with jeans, or even as a cover up over a cute dress. i am a generally a size medium (sometimes small) and tend to fall between a 6 and 8, i went with the 8 in this jacket!","Jackets"
"I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.","Jackets"
"Ok. stop everything, take out your credit card & order this blazer immediately! i'm obsessed with blazers, but was on the fence about ordering this one (i mean, how many black blazers can one girl own?!), but after reading the outstanding reviews, i decided to go for it & i'm so glad i did! the online pictures do it no justice whatsoever, & i was afraid the polyester blend & gold buttons would look cheap, but, boy, was i in for a surprise when i opened my package! the black fabric looks high-end","Jackets"
"This is my second jacket from this brand cartonnier and i am thoroughly pleased. 

i love the quality and texture of the fabric of this coat. i think the styling is super classic with a little bohemian edge. 

i am 5' 3"" and 120 lbs and the size 4 fit me perfectly.","Jackets"
"True, this blazer runs small, so size up! beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue, the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days. best of all this blazer could be worn 3-4 seasons out if the year and it's got a super-soft lining.","Jackets"
"This is a sweet little jacket. i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price. but after trying it on, i just fell in love! the cut is really flattering. the jacket does run small. i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves. my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous, because they seem to be heavy and i worry that i'll lose one, but only on the front 2, the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine. overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting","Jackets"
"I bought this yesterday in store - i agree it runs large and sizing down keeps it from swallowing you.  i typically wear a large and went with a medium.  love the grey color - it will make a nice neutral.  am looking forward to wearing this well into fall/winter as i'm in the south where it takes a while to get cold.","Jackets"
"I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didn't want to miss out again - can't wait to wear this when it gets chilly. i am between a s & m but the small was very comfortable. it could be easilly layered over a thicker item, or a t-shirt as pictured. so glad i picked this one up.","Jackets"

"First, i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short, because, well, it is. that being said, it is a perfect length for someone who is petite, like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets, which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size, is wonderfully warm and cozy, and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)","Jackets"
"This is the mid-weight fall/spring jacket i had designed for myself in my head! someone got into my head and made it! really - i could not have dreamed up a lovelier jacket. it fits like a glove, it's absolutely the softest thing ever, and the (removable) lining is far warmer and plusher than i expected (i wore it out tonight on a a clear, cold night - i felt like i was wearing a hug). nice, feminine waistline and pockets in all the right places round it all out. i look forward to unbuttoning th","Jackets"
"I knew once i saw this online that i would love it, because of that i almost feel like my review is biased. i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile. i own the holding horses version from a few years back, but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me (even though it has a drawstring waist). this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire. but it's not too tight. i am small up top, 34b but larger","Jackets"
"Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill. the 30inch length is perfect. the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch, fur ends about 6 inches in so not fully lined, but great for weather in 50's-low 60's with a sweater added . ample room for that. i love the look, wish the pockets were just a bit bigger, i can barely fit my hand in. but overall i think it's a keeper.

"This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o","Jackets"

"I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!","Jackets"

"First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints.","Jackets"

"This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.","Jackets"
"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled","Jackets"

"This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time.","Jackets"

"I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6"", 36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!","Jackets"
"This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size.","Jackets"
"I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4, 107 pounds and i bought the xs, which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.","Jackets"
"I love this jacket and can't get enough of it. it has side pockets as well as the buttoned-pockets. i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look.","Jackets"
"I'm always on the lookout for pieces that look polished, but aren't fussy. this is *that* blazer. i'm rather petite and bought the xs, though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame. the perfect weight for 65 degree summer days.","Jackets"
"This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!","Jackets"
"I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store, and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material, lined, and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet, i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale, i'll order a small, to see if it is more flattering. but at this point, it's a no-go.","Jackets"
"This jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear! i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters!","Jackets"
"Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet, but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined, and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i","Jackets"
"This jacket is amazing! i at first bought the medium because that is what i usually wear on top. when it arrived in the mail i put it on asap. it fit but was definitely too form fitting to wear a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. so i called the store and asked them to reserve a large and that one fit perfectly! it's loose enough to wear something underneath but not so loose that it looks to big. it is so soft and cozy, and the hood is my favorite part!","Jackets"
"I can't stop rubbing the faux fur. faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful. it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top, above my bust. its roomy so size down if you want it fitted. i'm 5'1"" and 120 with a 34 c bust and a short torso and i got a small. i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight. the hood is the best part. it's so drama","Jackets"
"This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned.  the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice.  for reference, i am 5'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering.","Jackets"
"This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater","Jackets"
"Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.","Jackets"
"Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it!","Jackets"
"I was so pleasantly surprised when i received this in the mail, because it's much more substantial than i thought it would be. it's perfect for fall and spring and the lining is very soft. i thought it'd be more difficult to wear but it goes well with everything! i ordered my usual size small and am happy with the fit.","Jackets"
"This really is a gorgeous jacket! i would give it 4.5 stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area (poofs out a bit) at certain times, but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat. i am petite and curvy on bottom, so this could just be me. tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute, i think i will try both ways. seems very warm. beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all! excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l","Jackets"
"Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees, it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"", 135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.","Jackets"
"The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing.. the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather. i'm very satisfied with the vest. i believe it runs a bit large. i usually wear a large, sometimes an extra large yet the m/l fit me fine. shearling is very in this year and this will complete your look-wearing either pants or skirts.","Jackets"
"Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.","Jackets"
"This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!","Jackets"
"This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!","Jackets"
"I had been looking for a jacket like this for months, but haven't found the right style, until i saw this one! luckily it was on sale. i am 5'10, weigh ca. 143lb's and i usually wear a size small in all retailer tops. tried on medium, but it was too big in the bust area., then i tried on the small and it fits great! the sleeves are long enough too, but it is hard to move my arms up to reach something, so i just have to avoid that. :) i have gotten a lot of compliments for it.","Jackets"
"If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person.....","Jackets"
"Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit, but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it.","Jackets"
"This jacket is perfect and drapes very well. i had my eye on it online and the second i put it on, it was a ""yes"". if you are between sizes, as one reviewer mentioned, size down. it's tts but has a little extra room for me on the 2, so i sized down to 0. 5'4"" 115lbs.","Jackets"
"Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-)","Jackets"
"I love this kimono! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame. you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement!","Jackets"
"I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket. it is so much cuter in person. my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season. it has adorable embroidery on it, the colors are vibrant. you need to see this in person.","Jackets"
"This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it, too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped, probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it, otherwise might appear too short.","Jackets"
"I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!","Jackets"
"I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium, size 6 around 5' 8, and i chose the m/l, which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric, which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care, i am exchanging for another one in small.","Jackets"
"When i saw this on a model at my retailer store, i fell for it. i love the colors and the weave of this kimono. it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular. it will be useful for cooler days and nights or air-conditionied places. the knit cuffs hold it in place. i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it.","Jackets"
"Wow.. love this blazer! it's not as structured as some blazers , but the woven fabric hugs in the right places. fantastic addition and great alternative to the good'ol black blazer.. great versatility work to play. nice weight for fall, but will also do well for my fl winter. it's longer than some of my other blazers, but i like it.. with the front pockets as they are, it makes for a unique design that gets noticed. i got the size 4 and i have broad shoulders for someone @ 135lbs.. makes for a n","Jackets"
"I got this jacket in the gray. the fit is amazing and it is soooooo comfortable. i love that it is a bit less structured - but still looks polished.","Jackets"
"This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.","Jackets"
"I love this denim jacket! it's just a basic light denim jacket with a casual, pre-worn, soft feel. i like how it's slightly cropped. i think it runs fairly true-to-size, possibly a little on the small side. i am 5'6,"" 125 lbs., and 34c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit. if i had wanted the fit shown on the model, i would have ordered a small ? but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser. i love it!","Jackets"
"I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length, it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color, it's just as pictured. like someone else said, you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!","Jackets"
"This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me, but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp, and sized up for the arms. ove","Jackets"
"This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said, it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference, i actually love the fit and thought it was tts, though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a","Jackets"
"I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.","Jackets"
"This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat","Jackets"
"This is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn't too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a 36c and while i'd normally take a small, got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i'd say this piece runs slightly small for retailer.","Jackets"
"I tried this on, left, went back, put it on hold, then finally took the plunge. i had a hard time justifying the price. not really a functional coat, too warm to be a shirt. but so unique, i had to have it!! i got the s/m. boxy, in a good way. got it yesterday with the antro members 20% off.","Jackets"
"This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it's not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it's lined with the softest faux fur), it's quilted in an army green, and it has the best trim along the arm. they could've cut corners on the quality here, for instance, with the beading or the material on the trim. however, they didn't cut those corners. instead, the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. can't wait till the weather g","Jackets"
"I wanted to love this but my hips interfered. it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure. beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right. sadly it was returned!","Jackets"
"This is one of those pieces that are timeless, special and absolutely stunning. the body of the jacket is quilted, very boxy, and the embroidery and beading on the jacket is what makes it absolutely gorgeous. the inside of the jacket is this super soft incredible fleecy fur. it adds to the luxury of the jacket. in regard to fit, its very boxy. if you live near an retailer i would highly recommend popping in to try it on. i personally wish it was a smudge longer, but i think the detail and style of","Jackets"
"Very cozy wrap!  the material is so soft.   find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night.  i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too!  and with the arm holes it stays on.  very pleased.","Jackets"
"This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the ""madeline"" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city, so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all, a girl has to make a good first impression...","Jackets"
"Ordered this coat in a small. it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect - i'm 5'5"" and weigh around 120. the sleeves are slightly longer than 3/4. the fabric is so soft, the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully. this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child.... she referred to it as her 'car coat'... i believe that was a style then. worth the $.","Jackets"
"Love this cost! runs large. usually wear a medium or large, ordered a medium and had to exchange it for a small. fits perfect now. not very heavy so don't buy if you're looking for a warm coat.","Jackets"
"I bought an extra small and i love it (i'm a size 2-4). it's warm, it's comfortable, it fits with everything, can be dressed up or down, it's not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coat...it feels like you have a new friend...","Jackets"
"I love this coat. it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others. it looks great with layers and is comfortable for 30-50 degree temps. definitely size down when buying.","Jackets"
"Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.","Jackets"
"I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it's tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm, too.","Jackets"
"This coat is simply beautiful. i love the slits on the sides, it makes it unique and sexy. i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging. i'm so happy with my purchase!","Jackets"
"I love this kimono. it fits great. and is gorgeous!!","Jackets"
"Even at 5'1"" this kimono works for me. because it's so light in weight the length and amount of fabric are not at all overwhelming. it can be dressy or casual, as others have noted.","Jackets"
"The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing, and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also, really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an","Jackets"
"I ordered the chelan wrap coat in the beautiful red color. it's artsy and will be fun to wear with jeans and other casual clothing. it's super comfy and fits true to size.","Jackets"
"Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it. the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store. perfect! i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in store.
this coat is soft and roomy. when it's buttoned up it has a great shape too.","Jackets"
"This trench coat is the best fit and feel-true to size and cozy! excellent material!","Jackets"
"I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light, airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s","Jackets"
"I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black. it's not -- but that's my fault and i love it anyway! it's perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter -- not too light, not too heavy. i get a ton of compliments! i'm 5'9"" and about 145, and a medium fits perfectly.","Jackets"
"I own several of retailer's kimonos, & this has to be the prettiest. the colors are rich & more beautiful in person. i can't wait to pair this with jeans & shorts this summer!","Jackets"
"I love this coat. i would definitely recommend it. i normally wear a size 6 or a medium. i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small. customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange.","Jackets"
"I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful, comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty, the ""dark orange"" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it's unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket, but i digress. the","Jackets"
"Nice vest, pretty olive color, hangs nice but...its just kinda funny. just hangs and really looks odd when tied. i like the laying piece just wished it had more ""umph"".","Jackets"
"Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.

if only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied).","Jackets"
"Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.","Jackets"
"I bought this and like other reviews, agree that the quality probably could be better, but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart, but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled, but the fabric is textured, so i didn't even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40's & 50's before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!!","Jackets"
"Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.","Jackets"
"Love the look and quality of this jacket. i&amp;#39;d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me (i&amp;#39;m just under 6&amp;#39; tall). wish these came in tall sizes!","Jackets"
"First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.","Jackets"
"This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.","Jackets"
"I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable, soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale.","Jackets"
"I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2"" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.","Jackets"
"This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette, so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand, and","Jackets"
"This is silly, but the moss is not brown as pictured but olive green. with that ""said,"" i am going more casual, and i love the ""flex"" of this coat. the shape is beautiful and the lining is fun. i waited two months to get this in close to my size 00. for my style it is a keeper, but this back order situation is not acceptable. don't know whose fault that is?","Jackets"
"I have been on the hunt for a replacement cargo jacket for about a year now. i thought this one was going to be it!! ordered it right away. i got it in an xl as retailer coats always seem to run small on me (i am very busty so sometimes the more fitted styles won't even close without a big gap). this is not the case with this jacket. it runs really big - it looks like it could be an xxxl...but the design is great with a zipper and button closures, pockets and cute back cut...the color is slightly","Jackets"
"This was what i was looking for ! the little stripes ,black and white color,the shape of the jacket and skirt together....well perfect. kind of. i purchased this entire ensemble. the skirt was going to be shortened because well i'm short. no problem ,this is a common occurrence for me. but the jacket would not work for me. the sleeves were way too tight for my muscular arms. there was no way the adorable shirt would fit in there. the shirt is adorable by the way. all of these pieces are made ver","Jackets"
"Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.","Jackets"
"I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it's not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!","Jackets"
"I'm 5'10"" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!","Jackets"
"Love the unique look of this coat. living in the northeast, during cold weather i wanted something warm that wasn't your run-of-the-mill wool coat. i agree with the other reviews about the somewhat ""bulky"" nature of the coat, but i'm not wearing a coat of this nature to look thin. i'm fairly thin, 5'4"" 102, i know i'm not bulky, so i didn't care if the coat made me ""look heavier"" than i am, it's a winter coat, get over yourself, no one really cares how much you weigh. so, if you can get past tha","Jackets"
"This jacket fits just a tad big, but it's quite comfortable. it's the perfect touch to dress up jeans! i've gotten lots of compliments.","Jackets"
"I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package, it was a wrinkled mess,lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful, the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.","Jackets"
"I was going to order this coat online, but i ended up finding it in store. there wasn't a 2 petite available but the store had a 2 reg and i found it to fit well enough. i'm about 100 lbs with a 5 ft frame and a 34d chest. i was able to button up with a sweater underneath.

this is a fabric coat though i think it could have been great as a wool coat. the design and the colors make it easy to dress up any simple or basic outfit. i highly recommend!","Jackets"
"Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again, a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.","Jackets"
"I initially ordered a small, but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like, even considering the style. (i was swimming in fabric!) i exchanged it for a petite small, and it fit perfectly. it goes so well with so many looks, and it is going to last a long while in my rotation. looks much better in person, too. my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received, this one had many threads loose throughout, which i clipped and think will be alright, but i expected","Jackets"
"The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it's cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get ""stuck"" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....

however, i'm such a sucker for a pre","Jackets"
"Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes, size down.","Jackets"
"High quality, and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso.","Jackets"
"I saw this jacket on the sale rack at my local store but the size was extra small, and needed a medium. the store was able to order since it showed back order . i do miss the charge send option, but still love retailer! normally i wear a medium in this brand. i received my order today and it's a beautiful jacket however there's a few things that could have been done in the manufacture that would've improved it. one, the jacket is not lined and it would be beneficial if the jacket was lined or even","Jackets"
"I really like the look of the jacket and that it is stretching. sizing a bit odd. the xs is pretty snug in the arms, body is fitted. but the small seems 2 sizes larger. the body is very baggy. i kept the xs, but can't wear sleeves underneath!","Jackets"
"Nicely structured, yet soft blazer. wardrobe staple. runs true to size. i would buy all colors, but restrained myself to the black/green.","Jackets"
"I love this blazer because it feels like a sweater but has the formal structure of a blazer. great for fall!","Jackets"
"Recently, i have been so wanting to get a lightwash denim jacket and i found the piece right here! i love that its cropped and so easy to wear. its not stiff at all and sized right. i got an xs my normal size and its so comfy and surprisingly soft. 
great find but just a bit pricey.. but probably bc its paige. too bad pilcrow couldn't have made something like this.","Jackets"
"Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.","Jackets"
"This is very cute and well-made, but unfortunately for my coloring and hair, washed me out a bit. the attention to detail is fabulous and it is a great layering piece for spring. tts but definitely longer as is shown in picture on model.","Jackets"
"I ordered this online, but i own the vest and i love it, so i took a chance. this is a super comfy, great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color, i ordered the green, is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that, you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended","Jackets"
"This jacket is a flattering although somewhat boxy. it does run large - i wear a medium and ordered a small. fits perfect. looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.","Jackets"
"Not for everyone - this coat has an intentional slightly oversized body and sleeves, with a short sleeve length, and a heavy fabric that is perfect for cold california winters (and maybe fall weather everywhere else). the weight comes from what seems to be a lining of a heavy hunter -green-colored neoprene-like substance. it definitely feels substantial and worth the price. a coat like this would look amazing with crisp, clean lines, culottes, joggers, flatforms/clogs, or can transfer into workw","Jackets"
"This is an attractive, fitted vest. the tight belt on the back gives it a new look, great shape. the fabric is good quality. the neck is tight and high. i usually get a small at retailer, but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest. judging from the photo, i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium. it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans","Jackets"
"This vest is so cute and a perfect transition piece for fall. it runs a little big. i normally wear an xs, but i had to exchange for an xxs","Jackets"
"I bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between. the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms, but the medium feels a bit baggy. it is soft and hangs nicely - i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price.","Jackets"
"I thought it would have been heavier, surprised it was so thin but it works. i live in the deep south so it doesn't get that cold. i wore it to dinner with a black top and jeans, it was super cute. i'm happy with my purchase.","Jackets"
"I am wearing a large in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.","Jackets"
"I honestly liked this little cardigan. it is a misnomer as a jacket. it really is more of a light sweater/cardigan, but i didn't have any negative issues like others on here.

pros:
- great feel on the skin and fabric. this really caught my attention. hard to find a sweater that's breathable for cool summer evenings or mornings.
- color scheme will go with anything, elegant touch.
- unlined making it breathable.
- runs large, forgiving it. stretchy. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l)","Jackets"
"Confused and a little disappointed because the s is too tight in my shoulders and the m is too big all around.  weird because i'm a 39"" chest+breasts so m shouldn't look that baggy on me.  please sanctuary, make a petite version, maybe that will solve my issue.  otherwise, this jacket is soft and relaxed and has no distracting collar.  price point is bit over indulgent for what it is combined with my issues.  who knows, maybe i'll try again?!?","Jackets"
"I knew this jacket would be mine as soon as i saw it online, but i also have a hard time trusting retailer's online photos by their color and angle etc. 

i took a gamble and, for the most part, it paid off. i do like the jacket's unique bohemian gone chic/uptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back. what i don't like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs. i feel like there might be one too many ideas, or they could have been toned","Jackets"
"Loved this as soon as i saw it. definitely darker than the photo; not as muted. since it was a jacket and i'd be wearing something under it, i chose a medium rather than the small i generally wear. the shoulders just fit and the rest was big making me look large. not a flattering fit and a major disappointment. nice that it works for the other reviewers but not for me. sadly, going back. the sweater shown underneath also runs loose and large so i'm exchanging that one for a small.","Jackets"
"I love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward. the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows. i think i might have to return it :(","Jackets"
"Subtly chic raincoat, with a lovely drape (except see below) and wonderful details like the large diagonal-opening pockets, snaps, and decorative cord. the striped lining throughout is a cozy but light jersey layer. the coat would be ample cover for temps in the high fifties or low sixties.

problems: the double zipper was hard to use, but in my experience with other jackets, you get the hang of a wonky zipper eventually.

there seemed to be a problem with a seam by the left pocket so that m","Jackets"
"I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4"" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside","Jackets"
"If you are looking for a nice vest, this vest is nice enough, comfortable, and soft. the cut is also flattering, but i just didn't think it was as special as i wanted. it looks like many other options out there, so i decided to pass.

xs fit me at 115 lbs.","Jackets"
"I like the way this vest looks: it's flattering and the color is nice, just like in the pictures (i got the orange one). i am 5'7"", 125 lb, got size s, and i am very happy about the fit.

just keep in mind that the material is very soft and thin. it is good for summer, but i expected the material to be more... firm... something to be worn on cooler windier days. also, the vest does not close - i would prefer the vest to have a zipper or buttons.

but if you need a fun and cute summer accesso","Jackets"
"I love this vest, good denim quality","Jackets"
"I'm 5'1"", <100 lbs. xs fits surprisingly well. the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didn't noticed they were long. the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual. 

the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top. even over a tee it was irritating in one spot. despite that, love it enough to keep.","Jackets"
"Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light, pretty summer topper...","Jackets"
"I received this jacket in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size so i ordered the s & m. i opened the medium first and found that to fit me well. i never tried the small on. fyi, i am 5'5"", 125 lbs. & 34a in the chest. it allowed some ""give"" room for layering, like the picture of the model. this is a very cute jacket, no doubt about it. i like the combo of the linen with the leather. the outside of the jacket is well constructed. the reason i put 4 stars and said ""but"" is because of the unfini","Jackets"
"I tried this jacket on in store, both m & l. both seemed to pull a little at waist/pocket (notice the raised pleat on the closeup. i ordered xl on line. it fits better but still seems to fit like the other two when fastened. snaps seem to be misplaced. on the plus side, the style is cute and there is brown (taupe) mixed in with the grey which is more flattering to brownettes. there isn't much difference in sizing of all three. i am not sure whether this is a keeper. open, it is fine and casual;","Jackets"
"Searching for blazers that don't look stuffy? this one fits the bill! mine is at alterations right now getting the sleeves shortened. other than the long sleeves the fit is very nice. this will be a versatile addition to my wardrobe. can't wait to get it back from the seamstress so i can wear it!","Jackets"
"Ordered this jacket on line. it is picture perfect. does run a little big. thought i would take a small but i'm exchanging for xs.","Jackets"
"Cute jacket, but size didn't work on me. 5'4, 135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops, but m in jackets. ordered the medium, but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer, but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.","Jackets"
"First of all, this doesn't come with a belt of any kind. that's a good thing, too. i am surprised that the stylist put one around this kimono. it looks odd, and, frankly, takes away from the shape of the piece. having said this, though, it is a nice accessory for basic tanks, t-shirts, and other tops and dresses that need a little umph...
the kimono is blue, mostly, but it really doesn't appear to be ""striped"". it is sort of a line of small dots. it is sheer, but the polyester fabric has some bo","Jackets"
"I absolutely love the look & style of this piece! perfect for summer evenings. only complaint is that it feels maybe a bit too delicate. fabric is quite lightweight, and may be easy to tear. i will be taking special care of this & hoping to keep it looking great for the season.","Jackets"
"To my surprise these vest came with sleeves,but only can zip up halfway,so that armpit will show and it looks like the jacket is ripped at the armpit area! why? that's a good question! it does run very small.i'm 5 feet tall and weighs 115 pounds,luckily the only one left is size l,so i ordered and it fits perfectly!","Jackets"
"I ordered this jacket thinking it would look good with so many of my current outfits. i'm usually between a small and medium in jackets, so taking the advise of the other reviewers, i went with a medium... while it fit in the arms just fine, the torso was tight! i couldnt even zip it up! i guess i should have gone with a large. after mulling it over, i decided to just return instead of exchanging. i felt the jacket had a much harder ""edge"" to it than my style is. i was very impressed with the qu","Jackets"
"I got this jacket thinking it was going to look different on me. while i ended up returning it, it fit me nicely and was good quality. it just wasn't the look i was going for.","Jackets"
"I'm 5'4, 112 pounds. xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top. fabric is somewhat picky, so long sleeve is necessary. overall, coat is beautiful and worth the money. nice, unique fall piece.","Jackets"
"I was so excited to receive this jacket - have been looking for a ""leather"" jacket for a while and thought this would be the perfect one. unfortunately, i have broad shoulders and it seemed a little tight. i got my normal size s based on retailer shirts. maybe if i got the m? although, the s fit well in the waist, so... also, my small chest (32b) didn't fill out the darting in the chest area. one last wish, was that it was a little longer. 
as with all hei hei, the inner lining was very cute. ove","Jackets"
"This is a nice everyday jacket to wear with dresses, jeans, skirts, anything. i ordered the only color that had petite left, the plum. i liked it, but the fit was a little boxy, even as xs petite. length was nice, however. color was also a nice neutral, though it says plum, it is a darker brown. for reference, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs - review on xsp.","Jackets"
"Almost perfect! this jacket doesn't have that weird vegan smell. it's soft, smooth, and very high quality. this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies. i'm a 32ddd and the m fit nicely, no squishing (as the other reviewers have said, the chest has room!). 

i got the gray, and i loved it it's soft tint. i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso, my post-baby belly. the jacket is sort of short like a peplum, and i want to hide the st","Jackets"
"I really like the soft and very wearability of this vegan leather jacket. my only wish was for the jacket color to have a bit more rose tone to it as the color description implies. overall a definite keeper!","Jackets"
"I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket, but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room, order a size up. the quality is nice, i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me, just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.","Jackets"
"I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and","Jackets"
